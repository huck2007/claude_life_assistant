## Notes
- OYTS: Honest gap is business growth — not where he wanted to be on leadership/growth focus. 70% unavoidable (priorities were health and family, both hugely successful), 30% style (working on it now through routines and command/control). Key insight: physical health was a prerequisite for the next business growth phase. No failure — learning and growth. "Calm seas do not a good sailor make."
- Architecture diagram work for TCS — completed current platform architecture brief and saved to work/awmm-platform-architecture-diagram.md. Strategic positioning to maintain platform control while giving TCS an exciting data science sandbox.
- AWMM Crisp transition plan drafted — email to chat migration plan and comms for Danny/WMM team. Saved to work/awmm-crisp-transition-plan.md.
