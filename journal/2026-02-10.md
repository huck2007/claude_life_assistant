## OYTS
*If you stopped calling yourself a 'data analytics business' tomorrow, what would you build instead?*

Would build a next-generation health and wellness platform — an "operating system for your life." Combines breathwork (Stoic-style), guided meditation (like Waking Up), guided journalling based on themes and objectives, with AI at the heart to help reflect, hold accountable, and make sense of the landscape. Interleaved with devices and computer environment — a true assistant.

But catches himself: thinks it would be a waste of time. We're on the brink of a Cambrian explosion of AI capability. The software/app building game feels like the worst time to enter — everything getting crowded by AI-generated content and vibe-coded apps. Acknowledges this might be self-doubt talking rather than accurate market assessment.

The irony: what he described is essentially what this system is becoming.

## AMWAP
*Where in your life right now is the gap between intention and action smallest?*

Daily rituals. The intention to invest in himself each morning with small but powerful rituals — and the action matches. Doesn't need convincing to do them (weekdays). Weekend drift acknowledged — linked to alcohol the night before causing low energy and delayed starts. But even in the drift, he contemplates, gets frustrated, and that frustration drives him back on the horse. The rituals are the foundation of the intention to be the best version of himself.

## Evening
- Log work hours [done]
- Freedom Gap PM [done]
- AMWAP [done]

## Notes
- Social housing outreach intel: TSM (Tenant Satisfaction Measures), ODX (Open Data Exchange) - NHS product "Public View" (scrapes publicly available data for NHS/hospital trusts), BCN AI Pathfinder (https://bcn.co.uk/ai-pathfinder/). Joel is commercial. Two white papers: "Overcoming data challenges in social housing" and "Aspirations and applications of AI."
- AWMM budget email to Danny — flagged Shopify overrun, Emma's holiday disruption, proposed flex-up model for additional work. Risk of being seen as a tax noted.
- Trustmark: Future Processing cloud ops land-grab identified. Two emails drafted — clarification to Phil, recommendation to Phil & Simon with AWS cost data.
