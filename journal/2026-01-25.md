## OYTS Summary
**Q:** What is one area where outcome visualisation and/or process visualisation could help make you stronger?

**Key insight:** Business growth and eventual exit. Two-step visualisation needed: (1) the process of growing to ~2.5M turnover with more professional delivery, better client acquisition, and more people, then (2) the outcome of selling and achieving financial independence for Scott and Jo.

Already has experience growing businesses/departments. The gap is regular checking against the plan, staying on top of detail and progress. Rejected the "business is in my head" framing - hired Becky specifically to take himself out of the numbers.
