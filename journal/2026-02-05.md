## Notes
- MIT done: Value proposition locked (AWMM, TrustMark, Impower), 12 outreach messages sent
- Sports vertical note created (work/SPORTS-VERTICAL.md)
- Value proposition saved (work/VALUE-PROPOSITION.md)
- OYTS: Fear setting technique from Natural Edge — Define, Prevent, Repair. Goal isn't fearlessness, it's stopping fear from dictating behaviour. Already doing this informally with Emma on marketing fears. Monthly fear check-ins as part of reflection.
- Screen time spike: 6h 11m / 114 pickups — worst day this week, well above baseline. Worth investigating what drove it.
- Pillow research for arm numbness/sleep — Better Sleep Pillow (£60-70) shortlisted. Sleep scored T again.
