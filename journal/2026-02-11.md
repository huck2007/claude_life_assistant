## OYTS
*What would your three best clients say you gave them that nobody else could?*

Eliminates frustration and aggravation. Clients say he "just gets it" — saves them work, saves them time. Delivers outcomes (cost-saving or business-advancing). Wrapped up in a single human being with a team that executes safely, cost-effectively, and reliably. *"These guys just take the hassle away. They are never the problem."* Acknowledges others might be better at specific things, but for his clients, whoever they dealt with before didn't deliver this. Knows they value him and the team on that spectrum.

## AMWAP
*What habit or practice has become so automatic you'd notice its absence more than its presence?*

Toss-up between journalling and cold water immersion. CWI — if it slips to the afternoon (weekends), it "burns a hole in my head." Six weeks in and it really makes a difference. Journalling is a therapeutic exercise. Meditation feels less prominent than journalling and CWI right now, but expects that to change as he gets better at it.
