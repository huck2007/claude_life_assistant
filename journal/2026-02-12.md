## OYTS
*What does the team need to become to match the business you want to build — and is that realistic in 12 months?*

Detailed team development map:
- **Anthony:** Master Power BI with SDLC principles (source control, CI/CD), semantic model separation, self-service support
- **Dave:** Needs to understand business management nuances, operate contingent thinking, be a positive team player — energy too often negative/passive aggressive. If the job is making him miserable, needs to consider options (careful conversation needed about strength and maturity)
- **Phil:** Thoroughness, approachability, solution build with DevOps principles, AI coding agents at scale
- **Eddie:** Professional services ops manager, multiple hats, agile delivery standards, quality focus, margin targets, resource management
- **Emma:** Marketing message crafting, pipeline building, steady supply of 1-2 new customers per annum
- **Becky:** Continue as is — detailed, studious data engineer, develop ML Ops within Snowflake
- Future need: software developer + data science resources (subject to winning right contracts)

Realistic? Yes, but dependent on: winning a new customer, increased Impower spend, reasonable Trustmark return, additional AWMM revenue for TCS project. WMM 90% likely. Trustmark 40%. Impower 65%.

## AMWAP
*What's one relationship that's stronger now because of how you've shown up recently?*

Honest answer: none standing out. Family strong as always. Friendships challenged by the alcohol-free socialising shift — gets framed as "boring" by some. But rekindling old friendships with Judgie and KD — visit planned end of month. That's positive.
