## Notes
Bounce-back day after Wednesday write-off. Full morning routine completed. MIT finally done after 3 deferrals.

**Delegation win:** 3 problems from yesterday's support disaster — delegated all three, everyone got there in the end. Avoided frustration of fixing it himself.

**Becky insight:** *"She's a keeper."* Responded well to leadership framing (unpaid foundational work, move at pace safely), then delivered fast. Worth investing in.

## OYTS
**Question:** What is a performance moment coming up soon that you can start rehearsing mentally today?

**Summary:** Tomorrow's meeting with AWMM CEO (Danny) and COO about the TCS sponsorship project. TCS providing data scientists + product owner to build analytics experience for running audience. Scott will be "point man" for AWMM, running the project with TCS. Building on CS's existing data platforms gives TCS a head start. Key tension acknowledged: CS could build this themselves, but can't compete on sponsorship value. Pragmatic positioning: better to be involved and shaping than marginalised.

## AMWAP
**Question:** 10 wins from the past 24hrs.

**Wins:**
- Delegated 3 support problems, all resolved without fixing himself
- Full morning routine — all 5 items including OYTS in the morning (not deferred)
- Impower roadmap finally sent after 3 deferrals
- Breakthrough meeting with Becky and Dave — Snowflake refactor, good leadership moment
- Trustmark Geography quotation sent — should bring in ~£15K
- Run PB with Sophie — 6 min/km, beat previous by 20 seconds, despite 3 stops
- Started wardrobe clearout properly — giving away clothes that are too big
- Bounced back from write-off day — *"Getting back on the horse after bad days is a skill"*
- Natural Edge mindset working — avoid boom/bust, all-or-nothing mentality

## Evening
**Scores:** Sleep G, Steps O, Nutrition G, Hydration B, Outdoors O, Exercise G
