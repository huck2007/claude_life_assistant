## OYTS
*The strategy direction is set. What's the first thing that changes next week?*

Take action every day towards winning a customer. No stopping until we've won one.

Specifics:
- Website refresh — do it in a day. Stop overthinking.
- Content calendar — start saying things on LinkedIn
- Case studies for each client — a day each, PDFs, on website, possibly gated content
- Build into outreach discussions
- Emma clarity: AWMM pays for 1 day/week at best. That leaves 3 days. Those 3 days are marketing/BD. Every day. *"We take action every day to recruit a customer, and we do not stop taking action every day until we have won a customer."*

## AMWAP
*What did you do this week that moved the business forward without you doing the delivery?*

- Formed management team (Emma + Eddie). First weekly commercial performance meeting Monday 2pm.
- Managed client relationships on strategic issues without doing delivery. Continued delegation.
- Dave and Phil on AWMM, Becky on TrustMark independently — supported but didn't do.
- Ben Fitzgerald biz dev meeting — *"might be in my sweet spot of how I sell, and engage and connect with somebody."* Acknowledged 4-5 more conversations needed before anything concrete.
- Took action on outreach — Andy Mitchell, Richard Gayton, Kieron Smith all progressed.
