## OYTS — What's the version of this business that genuinely excites you?
Building and owning the tech stack for clients. Not bolt-on data platforms or crummy BI dashboards — owning the experience layer, strategically and operationally important platforms. Proof of concept to hard, reliable architecture that stands the test of time. A handful of quality clients where the relationship is mutual — "they feel lucky to have us and we feel lucky to be with them." Small boutique team earning a few million a year, nice profit, nice lifestyle for everyone. Doesn't want repeatable problems ("it's boring, I go out of my mind after 2 years"). Doesn't want penny-pinching organisations with weak propositions. Wants to be pushed by people as good or better than him. Mutual dependency — tied together in a shared destiny around the platform.

## AMWAP — Clearest evidence health transformation is real and lasting?
23kg lighter. Heading under 13 stone within weeks, target 12.5 stone within 6 weeks. Transformed in scales, clothing, mirror. But honest hesitation: Mounjaro has been the accelerant, and phasing off from next week over 3 months. The real test is whether the behavioural and attitudinal shift sustains without it. Health mindset is the most consistently positive part of his psychology right now — exercise habit feels embedded. But food/drink discipline may be getting a "helping hand" from Mounjaro. Needs to be careful at the transition.
