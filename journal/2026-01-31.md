### Digital life and its discontents

- Phones are, to quote a friend of a friend, eating our children (he actually wrote a book called "Screens that eat children" which was largely about mobile phones)
- Much of the blame is laid at the door of the social media companies, but I think it's as much about the devices and the persistent communication as it is about social media
- I think humanity's mental health is being significantly affected by this phenomena, but it is more pronounced in children where they are yet to reach full maturity and resilience
- But make no mistake, it is impacting adults too, and where fragmentation of thought was disrupted by the web and its ADHD-inducing adverts and hyperlinks embedded in content, smartphones, social media and messaging apps have obliterated attention spans and thought processes
- Coupled with the polarising nature of fast content masquerading as unverified facts, and we are being manipulated into oblivion
- God alone knows where this is going, especially when you consider the way in which AI appears to be amplifying these effects and the existential threat that we are dealing with in relation to the impact of AI on jobs / human purpose in a post-work world
