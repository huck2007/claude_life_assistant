## OYTS Summary

Deep response to the AI pattern analysis. Confirmed assessment, owned Dry January miss, committed to mobility and hydration in Feb, acknowledged need to exit planning mode on client acquisition. Key insight: don't overload February — targeted additions (mobility, hydration), not an overhaul.

## AMWAP Summary

January objectives near-perfect score (only miss: Dry January). Key wins: Impower estimate finally sent, TCS meeting positioning went well — demonstrated current state to TCS, avoided proprietary AI lock-in narrative. Impower estimate is honest about what they need — won't be manipulated by budget constraints. "I have to be so good they can't ignore me."

## Future tasks

- Tomorrow (Sun 1 Feb): Monthly planning — set February objectives, January review
- AWMM roadmap prioritisation (carry forward to Feb)
- Ask Dad to fit socket in Tom's room and heater in downstairs toilet
- Confirm Tom for badminton Tuesday

## Notes

Last day of January. Monthly planning tomorrow.

Little thoughts / vignettes:
- A phone is a tool, not a companion — could be extended to AI: "not a substitute for a real companion"
- Avoiding a spiral after a really difficult day is an important skill I've learned
- End of workday routine is inconsistent and needs monitoring
- Running with Sophie has slowed — she's gone off the boil, which made it easy to ease off. Need to own it: running is for me, not dependent on her motivation.
- Manchester Marathon 2027 with Emma — emerging possibility
- Christmas skiing holiday discussed with Jo — active alternative to sedentary British Christmas

### Digital life and its discontents

- Phones are, to quote a friend of a friend, eating our children (he actually wrote a book called "Screens that eat children" which was largely about mobile phones)
- Much of the blame is laid at the door of the social media companies, but I think it's as much about the devices and the persistent communication as it is about social media
- I think humanity's mental health is being significantly affected by this phenomena, but it is more pronounced in children where they are yet to reach full maturity and resilience
- But make no mistake, it is impacting adults too, and where fragmentation of thought was disrupted by the web and its ADHD-inducing adverts and hyperlinks embedded in content, smartphones, social media and messaging apps have obliterated attention spans and thought processes
- Coupled with the polarising nature of fast content masquerading as unverified facts, and we are being manipulated into oblivion
- God alone knows where this is going, especially when you consider the way in which AI appears to be amplifying these effects and the existential threat that we are dealing with in relation to the impact of AI on jobs / human purpose in a post-work world
- To many people their phone is like a companion, and this is especially pronounced when it comes to absorbing social feeds and sharing their "self" via social media and WhatsApp / Snapchat
- They are stuck in the thick of thin things, visual experiences that don't have any or much merit (the doom scroll)
- The device has to return to a tool, otherwise AI is going to further drive companion-like behaviours and cause even further division and loneliness in this world
