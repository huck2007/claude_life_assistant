## Notes
- **Matthew meeting — strategic shift on acquisition:** Stop leading with who you are, lead with what problem you solve. "Unlock the power of your data" is our capability, not their frustration. Need 2-3 repeatable propositions framed from the client's problem. Founder-led positioning is the "why us" not the "why engage." Two-pronged strategy: warm network (Scott-fronted) + cold unknowns (story-led). Get to conferences. Full notes saved to work/matthew-todd-meeting-30jan.md. Outreach brief reworked to v3.
- **TCS meeting notes:** Be cute with the product — "give me your marathon times, stats about you, we predictive model for where you will finish." Each idea, Scott is the execute guy. Wonderful marketing tool potential.
- **Proposition ideas post-Matthew:** "WHAT'S MY CONVERSION RATE PROBLEM?" — need to find the CS equivalent. NITS concept (Not In The Training Set) — competitive advantage comes from insights LLMs can't make. Agent-to-agent measurement as an example. Jevons paradox reference (cost of analytics falling → demand should increase).
- **OYTS identity votes:** Strong votes cast — gym 3x, running with Sophie, morning rituals every day, evening rituals every day, cold bath resilience even on bad sleep days, visiting mum and dad weekly, theatre with Eddie. Sabotaging factor: hydration. Not drinking enough water throughout the day → poor sleep → challenges morning rituals. "All it is is a glass of fucking water."
