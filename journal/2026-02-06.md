## BA Meeting Notes — Daniel, Bicycle Association

**Outcome:** Positive. Not a commitment yet, but agreement to try each other for size with a discrete project.

**Key points:**
- Nothing has changed since last meeting — same trajectory
- Pete (Mesosys owner, Daniel's friend) now aware and accepting of multi-supplier model. Initially wasn't keen, but Daniel reassured him his position is strong — just expanding access to other brains
- Pete retains lead supplier role and Daniel will lean on him for technical assurance
- Grant funding (EITI?) still in progress — their guy Scott expects to land ~€400k soon (preferential status). This will unlock work packages.
- Strategy work: not off the table. Daniel suggested once past first project, Scott's involvement would normalise for Pete
- First project: discrete, fixed price. Daniel showed some concern on rate — asked about blend of Scott vs team. Explained more Scott upfront, more team ongoing, Scott dropping in monthly with oversight/direction.
- Working model: multiple 3rd parties, no single throat to choke, Mesosys still lead
- They're testing multi-supplier process first with American guy (data scraping project) — avoids doing organisational learning on CS relationship
- Technical details: No Fivetran (data via SFTP/S3), Toucan tech for membership management, Quicksight now called Quicksuite, playing with Snowflake toolset
- Daniel said if he thought Pete and Scott working together would be a problem, they wouldn't still be talking

**Scott's read:**
- Daniel is intrigued and likes the idea of CS being involved
- Dealing with supplier risk AND likely trying to address service/skills gaps at Mesosys
- Pete and Scott have a fighting chance of working well together, but Scott likely won't want to play second fiddle
- Outside chance Daniel is "match-making" — reading between the lines, probably not much in it

**Next:** Wait for work packages to emerge (grant funding dependent). No specific timeline.

## Notes
- OYTS: Deep one. Marketing avoidance driven by fear that team can't deliver what a "data analytics business" promises. Feels like lying. Saved to OYTS summaries.
