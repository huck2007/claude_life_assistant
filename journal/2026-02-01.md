Freedom Gap PM [done]
AMWAP [cancelled — bed at 8:15pm]

Bed at 8:15pm (exhausted after planning day). Woke 1:15am for 2.5 hours, back to sleep until 7am. AWMM/TCS project on mind.

## OYTS Summary

Hydration — without hesitation. Foundational to physiology, likely impacting sleep. Key nuance: need to get the water in by 6pm, not binge it in the evening (disrupts sleep further). Mobility considered but dismissed as a focus — it's new this week, so building the habit is enough without targeting perfection. Outdoor time also surfaced as a sleep factor (vitamin D, circadian rhythms).

## Future tasks

## Notes

- From meditation (Sam Harris / Waking Up): "...or just put a smile in your mind, if only for a moment..." — physically felt as warmth behind the eyes
- OYTS/AMWAP questions set for the week — fear theme for OYTS
- Significant calendar changes synced to CALENDAR.md and ICS
- Monthly planning complete: January review done, annual objectives set, February objectives set, Week 1 planned, Monday tasks ready
