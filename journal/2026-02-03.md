## Work Tasks

1. Design weekly work schedule — time zones for deep work, leadership, client management, business development [MIT] [done]
2. Invoicing sign-off with Eddie [done]

6. Monday Dashboard review with Eddie — first weekly rhythm session [done]
7. Finalise Productive setup with Eddie (overhead costs, staff rates) [done]
8. Review WMM Snowflake refactor project with Becky [done]

## Personal Tasks

1. Drink 2L water, bulk before 6pm (day 2) — fell short (only 1L)

## Health Tasks

1. Run — cancelled (didn't feel right for it, knew badminton was coming)
2. Badminton with Tom (evening) [done] — felt shaky and low energy during play. Likely nutrition/hydration related given Mounjaro and only 1L water. Tuesday nutrition needs planning.

- Freedom Gap PM [done]
- AMWAP [done]

**Scores:** Sleep G, Steps O, Nutrition O, Hydration B, Outdoors B, Exercise G
**Digital Life:** Screen Time 3h 32m, Pickups 43

## Future tasks
- Discuss schema evolution approach to AWMM DCM repo with Dave (CIO data upgrade, CREATE OR ALTER table approach, additional parquet sources, performance gain argument)
- Contact Simon for Dave's stretching routines

## Notes
- Eddie back today — heavy collaboration day (invoicing, dashboard, Productive, AWMM hours)
- Reminders due: decide August hiking holiday destination, decide lads weekend plans with Tom (24-26 Apr), think about 4-week mini-retirement
- Task inbox: reschedule Yorkshire 3 Peaks, ask Dad re socket/heater, book holidays into diary
- OYTS: Three relief behaviours named — alcohol, checking out/avoidance, preemptive resentment/catastrophising. Currently in serving state but knows the triggers. Sharp self-awareness: *"I sound convincing even when I'm wrong."*
- AMWAP: Habits sticking — morning rituals, gym 3x, badminton, moderate eating. Needs building: stretching, water, running (Sophie fallen off, needs to own it independently)
- 8/8 work tasks done. MIT done. Full morning rituals day 2.
- Weekly work structure designed and committed — deep work days (Mon/Wed/Fri), people days (Tue/Thu), monthly overlay mapped.
- Screen time and pickups both significantly below baseline (3h 32m vs 5h 4m, 43 vs 83). Strong.
