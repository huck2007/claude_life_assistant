## Notes
A thought: "If we spend all of our time complaining and decrying the actions and words of our adversaries instead of focusing on our own solutions and reasoning, let's not be surprised when their argument wins - a complaint is not an argument."

## OYTS
**Question:** What is a situation where you often feel nervous, scattered, or underprepared—and how would it feel to change that?

**Summary:** Client touchpoint meetings. Arrives underprepared, wings it because he can, but it's not professional. Root cause is absence of process — no enforced prep ritual, no accountability for Eddie/Emma to brief him day before. Formalising this would make meetings more professional and stop Scott being the one doing all the talking.

## AMWAP
**Question:** Focus on the year so far. List as many wins as possible.

**Wins:**
- Natural Edge restart going well — good moving average, better outlook and peace of mind
- Sales/marketing with Emma progressing toward Feb execution
- Commercial visibility with Eddie — draft dashboard working
- Running 3x/week for 3 weeks, VO2 max improving significantly
- Weight now lightest in 12 years, on track for target by end of Feb
- Reconnecting with old friends — weekly badminton, reconnected with Kris, monthly meetups planned
- Family walking schedule planned through September, first month done
