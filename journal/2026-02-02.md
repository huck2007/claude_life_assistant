Log work hours in Productive [done]
Freedom Gap PM [planned]
AMWAP [done]

## OYTS Summary

Fear of not winning new clients and losing existing ones (especially AWMM to TCS). Out of comfort zone on client acquisition — all prior clients came from warm intros. But naming it, acting on it (LinkedIn mining with Emma), committing to persistence. "I'm not gonna let it cause me to spiral."

## AMWAP Summary

Strong wins list: morning rituals near-perfect in Jan, 2 years lifting habit, 23kg lost, family trips planned for the year, meditation habit producing real equanimity benefits outside the practice, delegation actively improving, working on customer acquisition WITH Emma not FOR her.

## Future tasks

## Notes

- Weekly work schedule design deferred to Tuesday — TCS/Pallab email took priority (kept Scott up last night)
- Mobility day 1 done — new habit starting
- Hydration day 1 done — 2L target hit
- Weight loss now 23kg (updated from 20kg)
- Productive setup: Scott's done his part, Eddie needs to do final setup with the costs provided
