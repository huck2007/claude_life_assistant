# YEAR THEME

> "Take my technology/data analytics business to the next level — systematise and build, phase out of delivery over 2 years, focus on growth and leading the team."

**Project Eagle Vision:** Sunday morning on the veranda. Business running without me. Fit, strong, healthy. Present with family. Grateful.

# 2026 ANNUAL OBJECTIVES

> What will be true by December 2026?

## Personal

1. Work-life boundaries held all year — no major incidents where projects consumed personal time
2. Leadership focus maintained — balance exists because the business didn't shrink and pull me back into doing
3. A year documented through journals, photographs, trips, hikes — evidence of a life lived, not just work done

## Physical Health

1. At target weight: 12st 7lb. Off GLP-1.
2. A full year of running — strong enough foundations to begin marathon training programme in January 2027 (Manchester Marathon ~May 2027)
3. Strength training maintained alongside running
4. Energy and stamina massively improved vs December 2025
5. Overall fitness level very high

## Business

1. Completely out of project delivery — involvement limited to project oversight, client management oversight, and commercial performance management
2. 2 new clients on the roster
3. Existing clients (Trustmark, Impower) in as healthy a shape as their budgets permit — professional service, good account given, reputation intact
4. Business margins at 60%
5. FY2026 makes money (even if revenue/profit slightly down on prior year)
6. By December, run rate on track to break all financial performance records in FY2027
7. Business process systematisation and commercial oversight strong

## Month-End Review

*Completed 1 February 2026*

**Objectives achieved:**
- 2026 business budget completed (with Leanne, imported to Quickbooks)
- Impower Roadmap finalised (49 deliverables, Tiers 1-2, options A-D, sent 31 Jan)
- Monthly family walk habit established (Delamere 11 Jan, Feb Lake District booked)
- Quality time with Tom (gig, Burns Night, badminton, gym)
- Weekly planning ritual embedded (Sunday sessions every week)
- Clothes cupboard cleared (carried for weeks, done 27 Jan)
- Lifting 3x/week with Lou consistent all month
- Morning rituals near-perfect (breathwork, meditation, freedom gap, CWI, OYTS)

**Objectives missed:**
- Marketing outreach: plan developed but no outbound action taken. Still in planning mode.
- Dry January: ended Burns Night (24th). Owned. Friday/Saturday alcohol rule set as replacement.
- Evening rituals inconsistent (AMWAP and Plan Tomorrow gaps). Mobility dropped entirely.
- Monday Dashboard: Eddie delivered v1 and feedback given, but weekly monitoring rhythm not yet embedded.

**Key wins:**
- Morning ritual system is now identity, not willpower. Strongest foundation built in January.
- Health transformation continued: 20kg down, lifting automatic, running and badminton emerging.
- Recovery after bad days — no spiralling. Write-off day (21st) followed by bounce-back (22nd). Trained skill.
- Delegation improving: Impower estimate done, dashboard built by Eddie, marketing brief with Emma, support problems delegated (22nd).
- Trustmark expanded: Feb retainer from 5 to 11-12 days. Phil showed up.
- TCS/AWMM positioning: gave strong account in meeting, demonstrated current state, avoided proprietary lock-in.
- OYTS journaling quality high — connected insights across weeks, engine of the system.
- First screen time baseline captured: 5h 4m / 83 pickups (31 Jan).

**Key lessons:**
- Hydration is the highest-ROI fix available. Cascade: hydration → sleep → rituals → command → doubt recedes. Not fixed despite being perfectly articulated.
- Carry-forward culture: multi-day tasks disguised as single items (Impower email carried 5x). Break large deliverables into daily chunks.
- Reactive work from others displaces planned execution. Need protected deep work time.
- Planning mode can become its own form of not doing. Marketing spent all month going from plan to plan.
- Alcohol is a saboteur, not a reward. One night of drinks → tiredness and low mood. Evidence is clear.
- Brain can't cope with too many changes at once. January stacked a lot in — February should be targeted additions, not overhaul.
- Running needs to be Scott's goal, not dependent on Sophie's motivation.

**Carry forward to February:**
- Marketing outreach: first outbound action (exit planning mode)
- AWMM roadmap prioritisation
- Productive overhead costs and staff rates finalised
- Mobility: commit and stack into daily routine
- Hydration: concrete target and tracking
- Evening ritual consistency
- Screen time targets (baseline now set)
- Monday Dashboard: embed as weekly operating rhythm
