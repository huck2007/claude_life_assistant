# AWMM/TCS Strategy Document

**Created:** 2026-01-19
**Purpose:** Preparation for Danny/Dawna alignment meeting (Friday 23 Jan)

---

## Context

TCS (Tata Consulting) is entering a sponsorship agreement with AWMM, including a data/tech component. This has been developing since June 2025.

**Timeline:**
- June 2025: TCS proposed Data Strategy and platform build
- Scott reviewed proposal, confirmed much of it already existed (AWS, Snowflake, dbt)
- TCS over-engineered with enterprise-grade tooling unnecessary for AWMM's context
- Scott proposed Data Activation Strategy — an idea discussed with Danny for 2 years, never funded
- Danny enthusiastic; TCS keen when they saw it
- January 2026: Sponsorship confirmed

**The Deal Structure:**
- TCS: Providing skills (data scientists, product owner) + funding
- Crozier Scott: Providing platform + earning project fee (from TCS sponsorship funds)
- AWMM: Getting capability they couldn't previously fund

**Scott's Position:**
- Trusted advisor to Danny and Dawna (CEO)
- Architect of the Data Activation Strategy being implemented
- Platform owner and technical authority
- "Better to be involved and shaping than marginalised"

## Strategic Assessment

### What Crozier Scott Brings (That TCS Cannot)

1. **Platform knowledge** — You built it. You know its capabilities, limitations, and how to extend it.
2. **Relationship capital** — 5+ years with AWMM. Danny and Dawna trust you implicitly.
3. **Domain expertise** — You understand marathon/running data, the community, what matters to participants.
4. **The Strategy itself** — Data Activation is your intellectual property. TCS is executing your vision.
5. **Quality control** — You already caught their over-engineering. You're the reality check.
6. **Outcome focus** — You care whether this works for AWMM. TCS cares whether they deliver their contract.

### What TCS Brings

- Bodies (data scientists, PO)
- Budget (sponsor-funded, can't be competed with on cost)
- Brand association (Tata is a major name)
- Potentially: access to broader TCS/sports sponsorship network

### Risks to Mitigate

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Squeezed on rate ("TCS is free") | Establish fee structure early, anchor to value not cost comparison |
| Positioned as "just" platform provider | Actively shape scope of role — advisor, technical authority, quality gate |
| TCS takes credit for your strategy | Document your contribution, ensure Danny/Dawna acknowledge origin |
| Scope creep eating margin (Bug #2) | Clear scope boundaries from start, change control process |
| TCS under-delivers, you absorb the fix | Define accountability clearly — their deliverables, your deliverables |
| Getting squeezed out over time | Stay close to Danny/Dawna, remain indispensable through expertise not just platform access |

### Opportunities

- **Proof case:** If Data Activation succeeds, it's your strategy at scale with a major sponsor's backing
- **TCS relationship:** Could lead to other TCS-sponsored sports/events work
- **Profile:** Attach Crozier Scott name to something groundbreaking in the running community
- **Validation:** TCS recommended tools you already had in place — confirms your technical judgement

## Preparation for Friday Meeting

### Objective

Shape how this engagement works. Not asking for reassurance — defining the role.

### Key Messages to Land

1. **"I want to make sure this succeeds."** Position as ally to AWMM's mission, not competitor to TCS.

2. **"Here's the role I can play."** Be specific:
   - Technical authority on platform decisions
   - Quality gate on TCS deliverables (does it actually work for AWMM?)
   - Strategic advisor on Data Activation direction
   - Bridge between TCS execution and AWMM business reality

3. **"Here's what I need from you."** Be clear:
   - Access: Seat at the table in key decisions, not just implementation
   - Positioning: Introduced to TCS as trusted partner, not vendor
   - Authority: Ability to challenge TCS approach when it doesn't serve AWMM
   - Clarity: Understanding of fee structure and how it's funded

4. **"Here's what you get."** Make the value exchange explicit:
   - Insurance that TCS delivers something that actually works
   - Someone who understands AWMM's real needs vs enterprise bloat
   - Continuity — TCS engagement will end, you'll still be here
   - Honest counsel — you'll tell them if something won't work

### Questions to Ask Danny/Dawna

1. What does success look like for AWMM from this TCS partnership?
2. What concerns do you have about working with a large consultancy?
3. How do you see my role evolving as TCS comes on board?
4. What authority do I have to challenge TCS recommendations?
5. How is the project fee structured, and what's the expectation on scope?
6. What happens if TCS under-delivers or the relationship doesn't work?

### Questions to Answer Before the Meeting

1. What role do I actually want? (Be honest — where's the value for CS?)
2. What's the minimum acceptable fee/scope? (Don't negotiate against yourself)
3. What would make me walk away? (Know your line)
4. What's the best possible outcome from this? (Aim for it)

## Watch Your Bugs

| Bug | How It Might Show Up | Counter |
|-----|---------------------|---------|
| #2: Absorbs margin hit | TCS under-delivers, you fix it unpaid | Scope boundaries, change control |
| #5: Clients buy "Scott" | Danny/Dawna expect you personally on everything | Define team involvement early |
| #1: Steps in when unhappy | TCS does it wrong, you take over | Coach and escalate, don't rescue |

---

## Framing

**Not:** "How do I compete with TCS?"
**Instead:** "How do I make myself indispensable alongside TCS?"

**Not:** "How do I protect my territory?"
**Instead:** "How do I ensure AWMM gets what they actually need?"

**Not:** "What can I get out of this?"
**Instead:** "What value am I uniquely positioned to deliver?"

The answers to the second questions will naturally answer the first.

## Next Steps

| Date | Action |
|------|--------|
| Wed 21 Jan | Prepare positioning document, share with Danny |
| Fri 23 Jan | Meeting with Danny & Dawna |
| TBC | First meeting with TCS team |

*"Better to be involved and shaping than marginalised." — The right instinct. Now define the shape.*
