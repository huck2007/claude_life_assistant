# AWMM/TCS Meeting Prep — Friday 23 Jan

**Meeting:** Danny & Dawna alignment on TCS project
**Time:** [TBC]
**Duration:** ~30 mins to land it

---

## Your 5 Objectives

| # | Objective | How to land it |
|---|-----------|----------------|
| a | Safe pair of hands — they're confident you're aligned and safe to run point | Reference platform knowledge: "We built the data foundations — Snowflake, integrations, the lot. TCS can hit the ground running because the plumbing exists." |
| b | CS needs budget too | Direct: "TCS brings analytics resource as part of sponsorship. We bring platform continuity and project leadership. That's billable work — I want to understand how the budget flows." |
| c | IP stays with WMM, everything survives change | "My priority is that everything built survives any future change. IP sits with WMM, architecture is documented, no black boxes." |
| d | Genuine excitement | Be yourself: "I proposed the Data Activation Strategy two years ago. To see it happening now — I'm all in." |
| e | Budget clarity | Ask directly: "I recognise the commercial sensitivity, but I need to understand how budget works so I can plan resource and avoid surprises." |

## Conversation Structure

### 1. Open with alignment
"Danny's briefed me. I'm clear on the opportunity. Let me tell you how I see CS's role."

### 2. State your value
- **Platform knowledge** — You built it. TCS gets a running start.
- **Project leadership** — You'll run point, coordinate between TCS execution and AWMM reality.
- **Continuity** — TCS engagement ends eventually. You're still here.
- **Quality gate** — You caught their over-engineering before. You're the reality check.

### 3. State your priority (protecting WMM)
- IP ownership sits with WMM, not TCS
- Architecture documented, no black boxes
- Everything built survives future change or turbulence
- This is about WMM's long-term capability, not a one-off project

### 4. Ask the money question
"How does budget work? TCS is sponsored, but CS work isn't free. What's the mechanism?"

Push for clarity:
- What's the fee structure?
- How is CS work funded — through TCS sponsorship or separate AWMM budget?
- What's the expectation on scope vs. fee?

### 5. Express genuine excitement
"I proposed this two years ago. The Data Activation Strategy was always the right thing for AWMM — comms, audience experience, the whole picture. To see it finally happening, with proper backing, I'm genuinely excited to get into it."

### 6. Close with commitment
"What do you need from me to make this work?"

## Watch For

- **"TCS is free" pressure** — Any signal they expect CS to absorb costs because TCS is sponsored
- **Vague budget answers** — Push for clarity, don't leave it hanging
- **Role creep** — You're point man for WMM, not TCS's subcontractor
- **Positioning as vendor** — Danny introduced you as partner; make sure that holds

## Danny's Introduction (for reference)

> "Scott and his team run our technology platforms and lead the development of all new projects for us in the digital sphere. He will be running point on our side for this exciting project if we can get things aligned and off the ground."

He positioned you well. Own it.

## Post-Meeting Follow-Up

After the meeting, send a summary email covering:

1. **Alignment confirmed** — Restate the shared understanding of roles
2. **CS's role** — Platform, leadership, quality gate, continuity
3. **Key principles** — IP with WMM, documented architecture, future-proofed
4. **Budget understanding** — Whatever was agreed/clarified
5. **Next steps** — First meeting with TCS, any prep needed

Pull broader strategic points from `awmm-tcs-strategy.md` as needed.
