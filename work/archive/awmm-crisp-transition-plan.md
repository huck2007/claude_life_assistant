# AWMM Customer Support Transition — Email to Crisp

> Plan and communication for transitioning WMM from email inbox-based support to Crisp.chat

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-29

---

## End State

- Zero email inboxes
- All customer contact through Crisp chat
- AI handles first response / triage
- When AI can't resolve: user selects topic (Stars, Gold Club, Results, Other) → routed to sub-inbox → human agent picks up

## The Problem Right Now

- Team is toggling between old world (email inboxes) and new world (Crisp) — disorienting
- info@ is doing all the heavy lifting because it's advertised everywhere
- Marketing emails come from real addresses, generating reply volume into inboxes
- Manual triage from info@ to other inboxes is inefficient

## Transition Actions

### Immediate (this week)

| # | Action | Owner | Status |
|---|--------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Route all existing email inboxes into Crisp as sub-inboxes: stars@, goldclub@, results@ etc. map directly | CS/Tech | |
| 2 | info@ routes into Crisp main inbox (manual triage by WMM team into sub-inboxes within Crisp) | CS/Tech | |
| 3 | Temporarily disable AI auto-response in chat until email addresses are removed from circulation | CS/Tech | |
| 4 | Change marketing email sender addresses to no-reply@ | CS/Emma | |
| 5 | Change Runner Portal transactional emails from info@ to no-reply@ | CS/Tech | |

### Short-term (next 1-2 weeks)

| # | Action | Owner | Status |
|---|--------|-------|--------|
| 6 | Update website: remove info@ email address, replace with link/button to Crisp chat | CS/Tech | |
| 7 | Add "Contact us" instructions in all email templates — link to chat, not email | CS/Emma | |
| 8 | Audit all public-facing touchpoints for email addresses and remove/replace with chat link | CS/WMM | |
| 9 | Re-enable AI auto-response in chat once email addresses are out of circulation | CS/Tech | |

### Medium-term (2-4 weeks)

| # | Action | Owner | Status |
|---|--------|-------|--------|
| 10 | Monitor info@ volume — should be declining toward zero as addresses are removed | WMM | |
| 11 | Decommission email inboxes once volume drops below threshold | CS/WMM | |
| 12 | Full AI triage live — chat only, no email entry points remaining | CS/Tech | |

## Message to WMM

**Subject: Customer Support Transition — Clear Plan to Get You There**

Hi [Danny / team],

Following our discussions, I wanted to lay out a clear, simple plan for completing the move to Crisp. I know it's felt uncomfortable switching between the old email world and the new system — that's exactly why we need to commit to the transition rather than live in both worlds.

**Where we're heading**

One system. All customer contact flows through Crisp. No email inboxes. When a customer needs help, they go to chat. AI handles the initial response. If AI can't resolve it, the customer selects their topic (Stars, Gold Club, Results, etc.) and gets routed to the right person. Simple, fast, trackable.

**Why the current state feels difficult**

Right now you're operating in two worlds — Crisp and email inboxes — and toggling between them. That's not a sign the new system isn't working. It's a sign we haven't finished the transition. The volume hitting info@ is high because we're still advertising email addresses. Once we stop doing that, the volume shifts to chat and the problem resolves itself.

**What we're doing now**

1. **All email inboxes route into Crisp immediately.** Stars@, goldclub@, results@ etc. each map to a sub-inbox in Crisp. info@ goes to the main inbox — your team triages within Crisp, not between Crisp and Outlook. From today, you work in one place.

2. **We stop advertising email addresses.** Marketing emails move to no-reply. Transactional emails from the Runner Portal move to no-reply. The website replaces the info@ address with a link to chat. Every customer-facing touchpoint will direct people to chat.

3. **We temporarily pause the AI auto-response** while we make these changes, so you're not dealing with AI-generated responses to email-originated queries. Once the email addresses are out of circulation and traffic is flowing through chat naturally, we switch AI back on.

4. **We add a "Contact Us" link in every email** — pointing to chat, not an email address. This trains the audience over time: chat is how you reach us.

**The timeline**

- This week: Email routing into Crisp, no-reply changes, AI paused
- Next 1-2 weeks: Website updated, email templates updated, all touchpoints audited
- 2-4 weeks: info@ volume drops to near-zero, inboxes decommissioned, AI triage fully live

**The key point**

The discomfort you're feeling isn't because the new system is wrong — it's because we're in two systems at once. The fix isn't to slow down. It's to complete the move. Once everything flows through Crisp, you'll have one place to work, full visibility, and AI handling the first line. That's a significant step forward from where you are today.

We'll keep this tight and communicate progress as we go.
