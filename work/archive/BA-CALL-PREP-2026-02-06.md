# Bicycle Association — Call Prep
**Daniel | Friday 6 Feb 2026, 2pm**

---

## Background

- First meeting late 2025. Strong conversation — impressed by their journey from Market Data Service to credible industry platform on Snowflake/dbt/AWS/Quicksight/Fivetran.
- Credentials deck and rate card shared (£1,445/day Scott, £1,050/day team). Competitive position vs Mesosys unknown.
- Original plan was a joint meeting with Mesosys mid-Jan — scheduling issue, then BA decided to meet Mesosys separately first to introduce the concept of CS coming in.
- This meeting exists because Scott chased it. Not inbound.

## Key Players

- **Daniel** — Fractional CTO. Brought Mesosys in originally, but also brought CS into the conversation. Genuine desire to diversify/de-risk supply. Has a prior working relationship with Emma — will be straight with us. This meeting could equally be a thanks-but-no-thanks. If it is, he'll deliver it cleanly rather than waste our time.
- **Simon** — Budget authority. Decision-maker on spend. **Not attending this meeting.** Any outcome will still need Simon's sign-off.
- **Mesosys** — Incumbent supplier. BA originally envisaged them as controller of the programme. Strong suspicion Mesosys pushed back on the collaboration model. Possible shift from "supplier diversity" framing to "resource expansion" as the real driver. If that's the landing, Mesosys could equally solve it with an agency/body-shop — Scott needs to differentiate beyond resource, which circles back to the strategy work.

## Qualification (Jan 14 filter)

1. **Specific problem NOW?** — Yes: supplier de-risking, international scale (Germany, Australia), growing appetite for deeper insights/forecasts. But check if anything has accelerated — funding landed, new work packages emerging.
2. **Budget/authority?** — Likely Simon, not Daniel. Daniel is the technical advocate.
3. **Did they come to us?** — No. Scott chased this meeting. Not disqualifying (Daniel is genuinely interested) but worth noting — energy is coming from CS side.

## What to Find Out

1. **Has anything changed since December?** New funding, accelerated workstreams, shifts in Mesosys relationship? Don't assume — ask.
2. **What's the proposed working model?** BA likely envisages Mesosys controlling the programme/requirements with CS as an additional delivery resource. Understand exactly what this means in practice.
3. **What work packages are on the table?** Which of the four areas from the original email is live: strategic review, advanced analytics, multi-territory, delivery augmentation?
4. **What's the decision process and timeline?** Does Simon need to approve? Is there a budget cycle?

## The Mesosys Dynamic

CS will have a direct relationship with BA — that's established. But the risk is Mesosys controlling scope and requirements, which means:
- CS receives pre-packaged briefs rather than shaping the work
- No access to the strategic picture — always working with partial context
- Scott's CTO-level value gets reduced to delivery resource

**Red flag:** If strategy work is off the table. Scott can't add value without it — working on targeted requirements without the full picture is deeply frustrating and produces worse outcomes. The strategy piece is usually the natural 1-2 month entry point anyway.

**Acceptable alternative:** A well-packaged piece of work in the Snowflake/dbt space where CS can get to grips with the data properly. A single 1-2 month project to prove the relationship. But even this works better with strategic context.

**Framing if working model comes up:**
*"We're absolutely happy to work alongside Mesosys — we do this with other clients. What works best is when we each have a direct relationship with you for our respective workstreams, so you get full transparency on who's doing what and at what cost. Happy to coordinate delivery day-to-day."*

*On strategy specifically:* "The strategic review is where we add the most value — it's how we understand your data, your ambitions, and where the gaps are. Without that context, we're guessing, and that produces worse work. It doesn't compete with what Mesosys does operationally — it complements it."

## Strongest Cards

- **Strategic review** — pure Scott. CTO-level thinking, doesn't compete with Mesosys's operational role. Natural entry point.
- **Stack alignment** — deep Snowflake/dbt/AWS expertise. Same platform, different perspective.
- **Multi-supplier experience** — AWMM/TCS is a live example of working alongside another supplier right now.
- **Case studies** — TrustMark (Snowflake platform + AI), AWMM (multi-market scaling + data monetisation), Impower (multi-source data products). All directly relevant.

## Don't

- Over-promise on BI/visualisation capability (Quicksight gap acknowledged in deck — be honest)
- Agree to a model where Mesosys controls all requirements just to get the foot in the door
- Talk too much — listen for what's really driving this

## Do

- Ask what's changed since December
- Understand what Mesosys said about CS joining
- Push for strategic review as the starting point
- If strategy is off the table, probe for a well-defined Snowflake/dbt project as a proving ground
- Leave with a clear next step: proposal, scoping session, or meeting with Simon

## Strategic Review Framework

*If the conversation opens up, talk through this. 4-6 weeks, Scott-led, lightweight.*

**Phase 1: Discovery (weeks 1-2)**

| Stream | What | How |
|--------|------|-----|
| **Technical** | Architecture, platform health, cost efficiency, scalability readiness | Access to environments, documentation, cost dashboards. Hands-on review — turn up every tile. |
| **Delivery** | Analytics/BI approach, software development practices, data engineering patterns, CI/CD maturity | Codebase review, dbt project structure, deployment processes, testing approach |
| **Business** | Backlog shape, prioritisation approach, demand vs capacity, roadmap clarity | Backlog review, planning artefacts, Mesosys delivery cadence |

**Phase 2: Stakeholder Interviews (weeks 2-3)**

| Level | Who | Why |
|-------|-----|-----|
| **Leadership** | Simon + senior stakeholders | Aspirations, strategy, frustrations, where they want the platform to take them. Budget and initiative perspective. |
| **Operational** | Analysts, data consumers, day-to-day users | The real picture. What works, what's painful, what workarounds exist, what they wish they had. These conversations surface the truth that leadership don't always see. |
| **Technical** | Daniel, Mesosys leads (if appropriate) | Current constraints, technical debt, what they'd do differently, where they're fighting the platform vs working with it. |

**Phase 3: Synthesis & Roadmap (weeks 3-4)**

- **Current state assessment** — what's working, what's not, what's costing more than it should
- **Opportunity map** — where the platform can drive more value (scale, insight, new markets, AI)
- **Prioritised roadmap** — sequenced recommendations tied to business outcomes, not just technical wish lists
- **Delivery model recommendation** — how to resource and govern the next phase (including how CS and Mesosys work together, if relevant)

**Deliverable:** A short, opinionated document (not a 60-page deck) that gives Simon a clear picture of where they are, where they should go, and what it will take.

**Typical investment:** 15-20 days over 4-6 weeks. Mostly Scott, with targeted technical input from the team on specific areas (e.g. Snowflake architecture deep-dive).

**Why it matters for BA specifically:**
- They're about to scale into new markets — doing that on an unvalidated foundation is risky
- Mesosys built it — an independent perspective on what they've built is healthy governance, not a threat
- The review produces the roadmap that everyone (BA, Mesosys, CS) can align around

## Exit Criteria

- **Green light:** Strategy work is on the table, direct relationship, clear next step with Simon involved
- **Amber:** No strategy, but a defined project in the data platform space with proper access. Worth a trial.
- **Red:** Subcontracting under Mesosys, no strategic involvement, parcelled-out tasks. Walk away professionally — keep the relationship warm but don't commit resource to a losing model.
