## Why Sport?

Data & AI in sport can be for good in a way that other sectors can't match.

In most industries, AI/automation means efficiency — which usually means fewer people. In sport, the opportunity is different:
- **Growth over cuts** — building audiences, not shrinking headcount
- **Engagement over extraction** — creating experiences, not optimising away costs
- **Participation over surveillance** — helping people do more, not monitoring them
- **The product is human** — performance, connection, community

This isn't about "digital transformation" for sport. It's about using data to grow sport, not shrink it.

Personal motivation: I want to work on things that make things better, not just cheaper. Sport does that.

## Proof Point: Abbott World Marathon Majors (AWMM)

**What we did:**
- Transformed a static archive of 1.3m race results per year (dating back to 2006) into an active global runner community
- Built the data platforms powering fan engagement, not one-off campaigns

**What it enabled:**
- Premium loyalty club (AbbottWMM Six Star programme)
- Virtual running club
- Online merchandise store
- $10m+ per year in media value for partners and sponsors

**The story:**
> We turned historic race data into a global running audience that now generates millions in recurring value.

**Key insight:** The data was always there. We built the platform that turned it into community and commerce.

## Proposition (Draft)

**For sporting and fitness organisations:**

We help you turn participant and fan data into platforms that drive engagement, community, and commercial value — without losing what makes sport special.

**What we do:**
- Data platforms (Snowflake, AWS) that unify fragmented participant/fan data
- Audience products — loyalty, membership, community experiences
- Commercial enablement — sponsorship value, merchandising, media rights support
- AI where it serves the sport, not just the spreadsheet

**What we don't do:**
- "Transformation" projects that go nowhere
- Dashboards that nobody uses
- Tech for tech's sake

**One-liner:**
> We use data to grow sport, not shrink it.

## Target Profile

**Ideal client:**
- Has participant or fan data (events, memberships, results, ticketing)
- Knows the data is under-utilised but doesn't know where to start
- Mid-sized organisation — big enough to invest, small enough to not have it in-house
- Leadership that cares about the sport, not just the numbers
- UK-based or UK-accessible (travel manageable)

**Types:**
- National Governing Bodies (NGBs)
- Mass participation event organisers
- Sports leagues (below Premier League level)
- Endurance/fitness event companies
- Sports membership organisations

## Dream Clients

| Organisation | Type | Why Interesting | Status |
|--------------|------|-----------------|--------|
| **The Great Run Company** | Mass participation events | Organises Great North Run (world's biggest half marathon), Great Manchester Run, Great Birmingham Run. Huge participant database, direct parallel to AWMM. Results, entries, loyalty all in play. | To research |
| **British Triathlon** | National Governing Body | Membership model, event results, club data, participation tracking. Mid-sized NGB, likely under-resourced on data but has the raw material. Multi-sport angle (swim/bike/run) creates complexity. | To research |
| **England Athletics** | NGB (grassroots) | Focuses on growing participation, not just elite. Clubs, parkrun integration, RunBritain rankings. Mission-aligned — they exist to grow the sport. | To research |
| **Swim England** | National Governing Body | Learn to Swim programme is massive data asset (millions of kids). Club memberships, competition results, talent pathways. Different sport, same problem. | To research |
| **British Cycling** | National Governing Body | Huge growth sport post-Olympics. Membership, sportives, clubs, racing. High-profile, well-funded, but data likely fragmented across disciplines (road, track, MTB, BMX). | To research |

## Next Steps (When Ready)

1. Research and populate 10 dream clients
2. Identify any warm connections (LinkedIn, AWMM network)
3. Develop one-page sports proposition
4. Consider visibility — talk, article, LinkedIn presence
5. Test with one or two lightweight conversations

**Not actioning yet** — letting this develop alongside core business. Review Q2.
