# CROZIER SCOTT: TEAM CAPABILITY & POSITIONING BRIEF

**For: Scott + Emma strategy conversation | 10 February 2026**

**Purpose:** Map what the team can honestly deliver, identify where Scott is filling gaps, and define which business contexts CS should target. Working material -- not finished strategy.

---

## SECTION 1: HONEST TEAM CAPABILITY MAP

### What the team CAN deliver (without Scott in delivery):

| Capability | Strength | Team members | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Data platforms (Snowflake/AWS)** | Strong | Dave, Becky | Core bread-and-butter. TrustMark proves this works as a team delivery. Snowflake + AWS + Terraform. |
| **Applied analytics / Power BI** | Strong | Scott, Phil, Ant | Not data science or deep strategy -- but strong on business automation, operational reporting, dashboards that drive decisions. |
| **Operationalising ML** | Capable | Dave, Scott (oversight) | Can take a model and put it into production. Have done this. Getting stronger with AI-assisted tooling. |
| **Integration** | Capable, not enterprise-grade | Phil, Dave | Can connect systems and move data between them. Not at the level of MuleSoft/enterprise middleware -- but practical, cost-effective integration. Improvable with dev resource. |
| **Model build** | Emerging | Scott, AI-assisted | Not a core strength yet. Can do it with AI assistance but wouldn't lead with this in a pitch. |
| **Digital product / platform build** | Capable | Team under Scott's direction | AWMM & Trustmark platforms proves this -- but Scott is heavily involved in architecture and client interface. |

### What Scott is filling (the gaps):

| Gap | What Scott does | Why it's a gap |
|---|---|---|
| **Data strategy** | Scott does discovery, defines the roadmap, makes the recommendation | Nobody else on the team can walk into a room, understand a client's data landscape, and define where they need to go. This is the highest-value work and the biggest dependency. |
| **Solution architecture** | Scott makes strategic technology choices. Dave does cloud infrastructure design. Data/app products split between Scott & Phil. | The team can build to a spec and Dave owns infra architecture. But strategic technology direction -- what to build and why -- is still Scott. Without him, the team builds what's asked, not what's needed. |
| **Client translation** | Scott bridges business and technology at the platform/strategy level | Clients explain their problem in business terms. Scott translates to technology. Phil can do this reasonably well at the function point/requirements level, but not at the platform or strategic level. Gap is narrower than assumed -- but the high-value translation is still Scott. |
| **Blank-sheet problem solving** | Scott scopes new engagements from scratch | When there's no brief, no spec, no starting point -- Scott creates the shape of the work. The team needs the shape before they can execute. |
| **Commercial / relationship management** | Scott holds senior client relationships | Danny, Dawna, Phil V -- they talk to Scott. Eddie has a good relationship with Paul Henry, but Paul is not a strategic relationship -- he's feathering his own nest on his terms, persistently stringing CS along. If Scott disappears from the strategic relationships, they weaken. Emma is building this capability but isn't technical enough to hold the full conversation. |

**The blunt version:** The team is a solid delivery engine for data platforms, analytics, and integration. The gap is at the front end -- strategy, architecture, scoping, and client interface. That's where Scott is plugged in. The business scales when someone else can do at least some of that.

## SECTION 2: BUSINESS CONTEXTS CS CAN CREDIBLY SERVE

Based on actual team capability, not aspiration:

### Context 1: "We have data but can't use it" (Data Platform & Analytics)

**Client profile:** Mid-sized org with data scattered across systems, no single source of truth, reporting is manual or unreliable.

**What CS delivers:** Snowflake/AWS data platform, automated pipelines, Power BI dashboards and operational reporting. Clean, governed, usable data.

**Team can deliver:** Yes -- this is the strongest team capability. Phil and Eddie can run delivery with Scott in oversight only.

**Honest positioning:** "We build modern data platforms on Snowflake and AWS, and put Power BI dashboards in front of decision-makers. Your data, organised, governed, and actually useful."

**Gap to fill:** Scott still does discovery and architecture. The team needs a repeatable discovery framework they can run.

**Evidence:** TrustMark. This is the model.

---

### Context 2: "We need systems to talk to each other" (Integration & Data Engineering)

**Client profile:** Org running multiple platforms (CRM, ERP, ecommerce, bespoke systems) that don't share data. Manual workarounds everywhere.

**What CS delivers:** Practical integration -- APIs, data pipelines, ETL/ELT, connecting systems so data flows automatically. Not enterprise middleware -- pragmatic, cost-effective, gets the job done.

**Team can deliver:** Capable, with caveats. Not enterprise-grade (no MuleSoft, no iPaaS expertise). Could be significantly strengthened with a senior dev hire.

**Honest positioning:** "We connect your systems so data flows where it needs to, without the enterprise middleware price tag. Practical integration that works."

**Gap to fill:** Enterprise integration capability. A senior developer focused on APIs/integration would close this gap significantly.

**Evidence:** AWMM (Salesforce + Shopify + custom CRM integration). Delivered, but Scott was deep in the architecture.

---

### Context 3: "We want to do something with AI/ML" (Applied AI & ML Operationalisation)

**Client profile:** Org that's heard the AI hype, may have some models or experiments, but nothing in production. Needs someone to make it real and operational.

**What CS delivers:** Taking ML models from experiment to production. Building practical AI tooling into existing workflows. Not research data science -- applied, operational AI.

**Team can deliver:** Operationalisation is strong. Model build is emerging (AI-assisted). Strategy and use-case identification is a Scott dependency.

**Honest positioning:** "We don't do AI research. We take AI and ML and put it to work inside your business -- operational, measurable, connected to your existing systems."

**Gap to fill:** AI/ML strategy and use-case identification (currently Scott). Also, model build capability is thin without Scott -- improving with AI tooling but not independently strong yet.

**Evidence:** Impower (NLP platform). Delivered, but Scott was heavily involved in both strategy and build.

---

### Context 4: "We need technology leadership but can't justify a full-time CTO" (Fractional CTO / Advisory)

**Client profile:** Scaling org without senior technology leadership. Making technology decisions without expertise. Needs someone to set direction, manage vendors, oversee delivery.

**What CS delivers:** Scott. Strategic technology advisory, roadmap, vendor assessment, oversight.

**Team can deliver:** No. This is Scott. This is the gap that a senior hire would partially close.

**Honest positioning:** "Fractional CTO leadership for organisations that need senior technology thinking without the full-time hire."

**Gap to fill:** This is 100% Scott-dependent today. It is also the highest-margin, highest-value work.

**Evidence:** Bicycle Association (emerging). Danny/Dawna relationship at AWMM.

## SECTION 3: THE GAP ANALYSIS -- WHERE TO INVEST

| Gap | Impact if unfilled | Fix | Timeline |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Discovery & scoping framework** | Team can't start new engagements without Scott | Document Scott's discovery process into a repeatable playbook. Eddie or Emma trained to run initial discovery. | Q1-Q2 2026 |
| **Solution architecture** | Strategic technology choices still need Scott. Dave owns infra, Phil/Scott split data/app products -- but the "what and why" is Scott's. | Partially covered already (Dave on infra, Phil on data/app). The gap is strategic direction. Requires either a senior hire or Scott staying in architecture (not delivery) long-term. | Q2-Q3 2026 (hire) |
| **Integration / dev capability** | Can't take on enterprise integration work, limits Context 2 | Senior developer hire with API/integration focus | Q2-Q3 2026 |
| **Data strategy** | Can't sell Context 4 without Scott in the room | Long-term fix: senior hire who can do strategic advisory. Short-term: accept this is Scott's lane. | 12-24 months |
| **Client interface** | All senior relationships go through Scott | Emma is building this. Needs more technical depth or a technical person alongside her. | Ongoing |

### Priority order:
1. **Discovery playbook** -- cheapest fix, biggest unlock. Gets the team starting engagements without waiting for Scott.
2. **Senior dev hire (integration focus)** -- strengthens Context 2, supports Context 1, improves delivery independence.
3. **Senior technical hire (architecture/advisory)** -- the big one. Partially fills the strategy and architecture gap. This is the hire that changes the ceiling.

---

## SECTION 4: RECOMMENDED POSITIONING

### Lead with Context 1 and Context 2. They are the team's honest strength.

**Primary positioning:** "We build modern data platforms and connect your systems -- on Snowflake, AWS, and Power BI. Practical data engineering and integration for mid-sized organisations."

**Secondary positioning (Scott-led):** "For organisations that need technology leadership, our founder provides fractional CTO advisory backed by a delivery team that can execute the plan."

**What to stop saying:**
- "Data analytics business" -- analytics is a component, not the identity
- "Data science" -- you don't do it, don't promise it
- "AI-powered systems" as a headline -- it's a capability, not the core proposition

**What to start saying:**
- "Data platforms and integration" -- this is what the team builds
- "Applied analytics" -- dashboards, automation, operational reporting. Not data science.
- "We operationalise" -- take things from idea to production. That's the CS DNA.

### Service lines (honest):

| Service | What it actually is | Who delivers |
|---|---|---|
| **Data Platforms** | Snowflake/AWS data engineering, pipelines, governance | Team (Phil, Eddie) with Scott in oversight |
| **Applied Analytics & Automation** | Power BI, operational reporting, business automation, ML operationalisation | Team (Eddie, Becky) with Scott in oversight |
| **Integration** | Connecting systems, APIs, data flows. Practical, not enterprise | Team (Phil) -- strengthen with dev hire |
| **Technology Advisory** | Fractional CTO, strategy, roadmap, discovery | Scott (build toward team capability over 12-24 months) |

## SECTION 5: QUESTIONS FOR THE EMMA CONVERSATION

1. **"Which of these four business contexts do you think we can market most credibly right now -- without me in the pitch?"** Tests whether Emma agrees that data platforms and integration are the team's honest strength.

2. **"If we position around data platforms and integration as the core, does that give you enough to work with for outreach -- or does it feel too narrow?"** Gets Emma's marketing instinct. She may want breadth. The answer is: narrow and honest beats broad and hollow.

3. **"What would a prospect need to see on the website to believe the team can deliver this without meeting me first?"** Case studies, team profiles, methodology. This surfaces what Emma needs to build.

4. **"Where in our current client work is the team strongest WITHOUT my involvement?"** Forces both of you to name the contexts where the business already works without Scott. That's the positioning anchor.

5. **"If we hired one person in Q2, what role would unlock the most new business?"** Senior dev (integration) or senior technologist (architecture/advisory)? This is a real decision that affects what you can credibly market by H2.

6. **"Can we agree: we lead with what the team delivers, and my advisory role is a premium add-on -- not the headline?"** This is the strategic shift. Stop leading with Scott. Lead with team capability. Scott is the differentiator that closes deals, not the headline that opens them.

7. **"What does the outreach message look like if we're selling data platforms and integration to mid-sized organisations?"** Get Emma drafting in the room. A concrete message beats another hour of positioning theory.

## THE KEY TENSION TO RESOLVE TODAY

The business has two propositions living inside it:

**Proposition A (Team):** "We build data platforms, connect systems, and put analytics in front of decision-makers." -- Scalable, team-delivered, repeatable.

**Proposition B (Scott):** "I provide fractional CTO leadership and strategic technology advisory." -- High-value, high-margin, founder-dependent.

These are not in conflict. They are complementary. **A is the engine. B is the door-opener.** The mistake is trying to merge them into one brand message. The clarity comes from separating them:

- Market the team capability (A) as the primary proposition
- Use Scott's advisory (B) to open doors, build trust, and upsell
- Over time, build toward others being able to deliver B

The question for Emma today: **"Can you market A confidently? Because that's what we can actually deliver at scale."**
