# Outreach Campaign Brief

**Date:** 30 Jan 2026 (v3 — refined with Matthew Todd's input)
**Owner:** Emma (design & execution)
**Sponsor:** Scott (credibility, selective involvement)
**Status:** Working version — incorporates Emma's founder-led thinking + Matthew's proposition-led challenge

---

## Outcome

**By end of 2026:**
- 2 new clients onboarded, averaging £100k+ revenue each
- 5-10 qualified leads / opportunities in active pipeline

**Why now:**
- Trustmark revenue uncertain (likely to stabilise at a lower level)
- Business needs 4-5 active clients to sustain the current team
- "Hand to mouth" acquisition must end — the business needs a repeatable pipeline, not reactive selling

---

## The Strategic Shift (Matthew Todd, 30 Jan)

The v2 brief led with founder positioning: "Scott earns belief." Matthew's challenge: **that's what happens once they engage, not what makes them engage.**

**What makes them engage is the problem we solve.**

The outreach message must be business-problem focused. Not "here's who we are" but "here's the frustration you're living with, and here's what we've done about it for others."

- "Unlock the power of your data" = our capability. Not memorable.
- "100 people visit your site, only 1 buys — why?" = their problem. Memorable.
- We need the Crozier Scott equivalent of that.

**The founder-led positioning is still true** — Scott is the reason people say yes to the first conversation — but it's the *why us*, not the *why engage*. It emerges through the relationship, not the outreach.

---

## Repeatable Propositions

> These are the business problems we solve, framed from the client's perspective. Each needs a story behind it.

### Proposition 1: No-Hire Growth

**The frustration:** "We need data/tech capability but can't justify a full-time hire — and we've been burned by consultants who don't stick around."

**What we do:** Embed a senior technology and data team without the overhead, risk, or recruitment pain. Grow capability without growing headcount.

**The story:** World Marathon Majors — built an entire data platform, CRM, analytics capability, and AI-powered automation with zero permanent hires. Now handling global marathon data for 6 major races across 4 continents.

**The line:** *"We built a world-class data operation for the world's biggest marathon series — without them hiring a single person."*

### Proposition 2: The £25-to-£3 Problem

**The frustration:** "We know our processes are expensive and manual, but we don't know where to start — and AI feels like hype."

**What we do:** Find the processes bleeding money, automate them pragmatically (not with slides and roadmaps), and deliver measurable cost reduction and capacity breakthrough.

**The story:** Trustmark — desktop assurance audits cost £25 each, manually processed, with a hard ceiling of 1,200 per month. We automated the process end-to-end. Cost dropped to £3 per audit. Capacity went from 1,200/month to effectively unlimited — they can now audit 100% of projects, not a sample. *(Note: specific capacity numbers are commercially sensitive — use "from a sample to 100% coverage" externally.)*

**The line:** *"A compliance process that cost £25 and could only cover a fraction of their projects? We got it to £3 and 100% coverage. Not with a strategy deck — with working software."*

### Proposition 3: TBD

*Scott and Emma to define in Monday alignment session. Proposition 3 (visibility/BI) dropped — too old school. Need something that lands differently. Candidates to explore:*
- *AI readiness / "AI without the hype"?*
- *Regulation / compliance pressure?*
- *Digital product build for non-tech organisations?*
- *Something else entirely — what frustration keeps coming up in prospect conversations?*

---

## Target Profile

**Who we want:**
- Sub-£50m turnover (sweet spot: sub-£20m)
- No in-house data / technology leadership
- CEO / MD access available
- Increasing organisational complexity (growth, regulation, ambition)
- Data exists but leadership visibility is limited
- Foundations not designed for current or future demands (AI, automation)
- Healthy margins and appetite to invest

**Who we avoid:**
- Retail / e-commerce
- Low-margin or volume-driven businesses
- Organisations seeking analytics support only

---

## Sectors to Explore

**Priority:**
- Sport / membership organisations
- Charity / not-for-profit
- Asset-heavy or compliance-adjacent organisations

---

## Two-Pronged Outreach Strategy

### Channel 1: Network (warm)

**Audience:** People who already know Scott — LinkedIn connections, referral partners, former colleagues.

**Tone:** Friendly, direct, Scott-fronted.

**Message pattern:** "This is Scott. These are the problems my team has recently solved. Which of your clients / contacts have similar problems?"

**Channels:**
- LinkedIn direct messages (Scott-authored, Emma-managed)
- Warm introductions via Matthew, Nimble, existing network
- Referral partners (fractional CTOs, consultants)

### Channel 2: Unknowns (cold)

**Audience:** Targeted prospects who don't know Scott.

**Tone:** Problem-led, story-driven. They engage with the problem/opportunity, not the person.

**Message pattern:** Lead with the proposition. The story is the hook. Scott's credibility emerges if they engage.

**Channels:**
- Targeted LinkedIn outreach (Emma-fronted)
- LinkedIn content (stories, lessons, counter-views on posts in the proposition space)
- Conferences and events (see Events Strategy below)

### Channel 3: Events & Conferences

**Audience:** Senior leaders in target sectors, at events where they're thinking about business problems (not tech conferences full of vendors).

**Approach:**
- Attend as a practitioner, not a seller
- Be the "I'll get you from £25 to £1" person in the room
- Speaking slots where possible — position as someone who's done it, not someone selling it
- Targeted networking at smaller roundtables and breakfasts

*[See separate events shortlist — research in progress]*

## Why Us (The Trust Sequence)

> This is what they discover once they engage — not the outreach message.

1. **Scott earns belief** — "Will this person understand my mess? Have they seen this before?" Those questions are answered by Scott.
2. **Crozier Scott earns confidence** — continuity, depth, resilience, delivery capacity.
3. **The team earns reliance** — consistent, senior-level execution.

The founder-led positioning is real. People do buy Scott first. But it's not scalable as the outreach message — it's what converts interest into trust once a conversation starts.

---

## LinkedIn Content Strategy

**Principle:** Always think about the recipient. Does it land the proposition message?

**What to post:**
- Stories from real projects (anonymised where needed) — the lessons, the surprises, the results
- Technical and operational learnings framed as business outcomes
- Counter-views or complementary takes on posts in the data/AI/automation space
- "No hire growth" narrative — how mid-sized organisations get capability without headcount

**What not to post:**
- Capability statements ("We do data analytics")
- Generic thought leadership
- Anything that sounds like every other consultancy

---

## Outreach Messaging

### Warm (to network)

> Hi [Name] — hope you're well.
>
> Quick one — we've recently done some work I think you'd find interesting. [One sentence about a specific project outcome, e.g., "We built a full data and analytics operation for a global sports organisation without them hiring a single person."]
>
> I'm always looking to connect with leaders facing similar challenges. If anyone in your network is wrestling with [proposition-specific frustration], I'd welcome an introduction.
>
> Scott

### Cold (to unknowns)

> Hi [Name] — hope you don't mind the message.
>
> I'm Emma at Crozier Scott. I'm reaching out because [proposition-specific frustration, e.g., "a lot of organisations at your stage are sitting on data that should be driving decisions — but leadership can't actually see what's happening."]
>
> We recently [one-line story, e.g., "helped a global sports organisation build their entire analytics capability without hiring a single person — from data platform to AI-powered automation."]
>
> If that sounds relevant, I'd be happy to share more. If not, no need to respond.
>
> Best,
> Emma

## Open Questions

1. **Proposition 3** — Scott and Emma to define in Monday alignment session. Dropped the BI/visibility angle — needs something fresher.
2. **Website messaging** — "Unlock the power of your data" needs to change. What replaces it? Should each proposition have a landing page?
3. **Diagnostic / review offering** — Still undefined. What does the client get? This could be a strong lead magnet if properly defined. Matthew didn't weigh in on this directly.
4. **Case studies** — Which projects to write up? Aligned to which proposition? Trustmark timing?
5. **Outreach cadence** — Emma to propose a realistic number per week. Quality over volume.
6. **Conference shortlist** — Research in progress. Scott to review and commit to 2-3 events.
7. **LinkedIn content plan** — Who writes? What cadence? Scott or Emma or both?

---

## Not in Scope (Yet)

- Resourcing plan for delivery (data science, AI automation, customer-facing PMs)
- Tooling for AI automation capability
- Paid outreach tools (LinkedIn Sales Navigator etc.) — revisit if organic approach gains traction
- Speaker profile / bio for conference submissions
