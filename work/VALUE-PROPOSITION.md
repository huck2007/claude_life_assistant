## The 30-Second Elevator Pitch

> "We help organisations turn under-used data into platforms that drive real outcomes.
>
> For World Marathon Majors, we turned a historic results database into a global digital community — now generating $10 million a year in media value and $3 million in direct revenue from data products.
>
> For TrustMark, we built an enterprise data and AI platform that automated assurance at scale — cutting audit costs from £23 to £1 and enabling 100% coverage.
>
> For Impower, we replaced a failing spreadsheet system with a cloud platform that tripled their sales pipeline, enabled over £500k in new consulting revenue, and eliminated £60k of annual manual work.
>
> That's what we do: platforms that create revenue, cut costs, or unlock capabilities that weren't possible before."

## Client Proof Points

### Abbott World Marathon Majors (AWMM)

**Before → After:**
> From historic race results to a global digital audience and commercial engine.

**What we did:**
- Turned a static archive of 1.3m race results per year (since 2006) into an active global runner community
- Built the data platforms powering fan engagement, not one-off campaigns
- Enabled premium loyalty (Six Star programme), virtual running club, and e-commerce

**Value created:**
- $10m+ per year in media value for partners and sponsors
- $3m revenue from data products (loyalty, virtual running, merch)

**One-liner:**
> "We transformed data into a global running audience that now generates $13m+ in annual value."

### TrustMark

**Before → After:**
> From fragmented assurance data to a scalable, AI-enabled operating platform.

**What we did:**
- Built an enterprise data platform underpinning BI, advanced analytics, and GenAI
- Automated assurance operations where human processes couldn't scale
- Enabled 100% project coverage, not just sampled compliance

**Value created:**
- Reduced audit costs from £23 to £1 per audit
- Scaled to 100% coverage where manual operations couldn't

**One-liner:**
> "We made large-scale assurance economically and operationally possible."

---

### Impower

**Before → After:**
> From spreadsheet chaos to the operational backbone of a new analytics capability.

**What we did:**
- Inherited a legacy nightmare — spreadsheets breaking on every update, stuck publishing once a year, previous agency had failed
- Built a modern cloud platform (AWS/Snowflake/dbt/Power BI) with a configuration layer that abstracts away the data engineering
- Moved from annual publishing to automatic daily metric updates across 12 benchmarking areas
- Platform now central to a newly-founded Applied Analytics Team — we helped create and train them

**Value created:**
- 3x annual pipeline opportunities during Index publication
- £500k+ consulting revenue from Applied Analytics Team (and growing)
- £60k annual manual data work eliminated
- Updates that took weeks/months now happen in minutes

**One-liner:**
> "We replaced their failing spreadsheet system with a platform that tripled their pipeline, enabled £500k+ in new revenue, and eliminated £60k of annual cost."

## Three Archetypes

When telling the story, each client represents a different type of value:

1. **Audience & monetisation** (AWMM) — turning data into community and revenue
2. **Operational efficiency at scale** (TrustMark) — doing what humans can't, at fraction of cost
3. **Capability building** (Impower) — creating new functions and teams, not just fixing systems
