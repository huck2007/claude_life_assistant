## Raw Notes

### Acquisition Strategy

**The North Star question: What's the repeatable problem?**
- Matthew's example from Logan Tod (e-commerce): "100 people come to the website and only 1 buys. Why? We fix that."
- Simple, memorable, business-problem focused.

**Stop the hand-to-mouth approach**
- The Trustmark situation has forced the issue — time to get structured.
- Need a few clear propositions.
- Frame from the business problem / opportunity perspective, not from capability.

**Current website message is wrong**
- "Unlock the power of your data" — too focused on the problem from our capability perspective.
- If somebody has data that isn't delivering value, connect on the basis of their problem / opportunity.
- What are they trying to get done? Relate the message to the frustration they are experiencing.

**Conference and market positioning**
- When was the last conference I went to?
- How are organisations in our space messaging? What problems / opportunities are they talking about?
- We walk the walk where others just talk — we've been solving problems with data analytics, automation, and AI for years.
- Example: "We're the guys who get you from a process that costs £25 to £3 — and even down to £1 if you're stuck in Europe."
- The cost of analytics is now 20% of what it was — Matthew thinks this should drive demand, not reduce it.

**Define 2-3 positions**
- The problem with "What's your problem, I'll solve it?" — it isn't memorable. It's boring.
- The message should be business-objective focused (e.g., "How do we get from £25 to £1?")
- Founder-led positioning isn't scalable (Scott noted he feels he needs one more "involved opportunity" — Matthew would say that's the hand-to-mouth reflex)
- **"No hire growth" proposition** — what CS has been doing at WMM and increasingly with AI. Concrete, memorable.

### Outreach Approach

**Stories, not positioning statements**
- The outreach needs stories: cost saving, revenue growth, unknowable insights.
- What are the business problems I've solved?
- Talk about the lessons: technical, operational, business learnings.

**Two audiences, two approaches**
- People who know me: they know I'm a "get in and fix it, nice guy." They're already warm.
- People who don't: they don't know that, and it doesn't matter. They engage with the story, the problem solved, as it relates to their situation.

**Outreach messaging principles**
- Always think about the recipient — does it land the proposition message?
- Comment on other posts in the proposition space (counter view, complementary view).

**Two-pronged strategy: LinkedIn + conferences + network**
1. **To the network** (warm, friendly language): "This is Scott. These are the problems my team has recently solved. Which of your clients have similar problems?"
2. **To the unknowns**: Stories, positions focused on propositions / frustrations.

## Key Takeaway

Stop leading with who you are. Lead with what problem you solve. The founder-led positioning is real but it's not the outreach message — it's what they discover once they engage.
