# CROZIER SCOTT: DISCOVERY PROCESS FOR HIGH-VALUE DATA & AI ENGAGEMENTS

**Version:** 1.0 | **Date:** 10 February 2026
**Purpose:** Repeatable discovery methodology for qualifying, scoping, and winning strategic Data & AI engagements. Two-phase process: team runs initial landscape discovery, Scott leads strategic discovery.

---

## HOW THIS DOCUMENT WORKS

Three gates, two phases, clear handoffs.

```
QUALIFICATION GATE          PHASE 1                    PHASE 2                  OUTPUT
(Team: 30 mins)             (Team: 1-2 sessions)       (Scott: 1-2 sessions)    (Joint: report + proposal)

Score the opportunity  -->  Map the landscape     -->  Strategic discovery  --> Discovery report
Go / No-go / Park          Stakeholders, data,        Business alignment,      Roadmap + investment case
                            tech, maturity             architecture, value      Engagement proposal
```

**Rule:** No opportunity reaches Scott without passing Qualification AND Phase 1. This is the whole point -- protect Scott's time for the work that only he can do.

---

## DISCOVERY ENGAGEMENT TIERS

Not every opportunity warrants the same investment. The qualification score and engagement value determine which tier applies. The process is the same -- the depth changes.

### Tier 1: Focused Discovery (5-7 days)

**When:** Qualified opportunities in the £30-80k engagement range. Clear problem, limited stakeholder complexity. CS has done similar work before.

| Element | What's included |
|---|---|
| **Qualification** | Full scorecard (team) |
| **Phase 1** | Pre-meeting research (lighter -- 2-3 hours). 1 discovery session. Data landscape canvas and maturity scorecard completed. |
| **Phase 2** | 1 strategic session with Scott. Focused on diagnosis and architecture direction. No multi-stakeholder sessions. |
| **Output** | Condensed discovery summary (3-5 pages, not full report). Roadmap. Proposal. |
| **Effort** | Team: 2-3 days. Scott: 2-3 days. |
| **Fee** | £5-8k (paid engagement) or absorbed into first phase if confident of conversion. |

**Typical scenario:** Mid-sized company needs a data platform or wants to modernise their analytics. Problem is understood, decision-maker is engaged, scope is bounded.

---

### Tier 2: Standard Discovery (10-12 days)

**When:** Qualified opportunities in the £80-200k range. Multiple stakeholders, some organisational complexity. Needs architecture and roadmapping.

| Element | What's included |
|---|---|
| **Qualification** | Full scorecard (team) |
| **Phase 1** | Full pre-meeting research. 2 discovery sessions. All templates completed. Stakeholder mapping. |
| **Phase 2** | 1-2 strategic sessions with Scott. Architecture vision whiteboarded. Opportunity prioritisation with client. Commercial framing. |
| **Output** | Full discovery report (10-15 pages). Phased roadmap. Investment case. Engagement proposal. |
| **Effort** | Team: 4-5 days. Scott: 5-7 days. |
| **Fee** | £10-18k (always paid -- this is a consulting engagement, not a sales cost). |

**Typical scenario:** Organisation with data across multiple systems, several business units affected, needs a coherent strategy and phased approach. Board or C-suite involvement.

---

### Tier 3: Strategic Discovery (15-20 days)

**When:** High-value opportunities at £200k+ or ongoing retainer potential. Complex organisations, multiple stakeholder groups, significant architectural decisions. Often leads to fractional CTO or long-term advisory relationship.

| Element | What's included |
|---|---|
| **Qualification** | Full scorecard (team) |
| **Phase 1** | Comprehensive pre-meeting research including industry benchmarking. 2-3 discovery sessions across stakeholder groups. All templates completed. |
| **Phase 2** | 2-3 strategic sessions with Scott across different stakeholder levels (operational, leadership, board). Deep architecture design. Multi-horizon roadmap. Detailed value modelling. |
| **Output** | Comprehensive discovery report (20+ pages). Architecture document. Multi-phase roadmap with investment case per phase. Board-ready summary. Engagement proposal with governance model. |
| **Effort** | Team: 5-7 days. Scott: 10-13 days. |
| **Fee** | £18-30k (paid engagement -- non-negotiable at this level. If they won't pay for discovery, they won't pay for delivery). |

**Typical scenario:** Enterprise or complex mid-market organisation undertaking significant data/digital transformation. Multiple systems, departments, and decision-makers. Strategic relationship potential.

---

### Tier Selection Guide

The qualification score points you toward the right tier, but use judgement.

| Qualification Score | Engagement Value | Recommended Tier |
|---|---|---|
| 15-17 | £30-80k | Tier 1: Focused |
| 18-21 | £80-200k | Tier 2: Standard |
| 22-25 | £200k+ | Tier 3: Strategic |

**Principles:**
- **Discovery is always paid.** At Tier 2 and 3, this is non-negotiable. At Tier 1, it can be absorbed into Phase 1 delivery if conversion confidence is high -- but the default is paid.
- **Tier up, not down.** If you're unsure, go with the higher tier. Underinvesting in discovery leads to underscoped engagements and margin erosion -- one of CS's known patterns.
- **AI accelerates documentation, not thinking.** AI tools compress research, report drafting, and template work. This saves 2-3 days on documentation across all tiers. It does not reduce the days spent in the room, on architecture, or building the client relationship. Price for the value of the thinking, not the hours on the document.
- **The discovery fee is a qualification signal.** Clients who won't pay for discovery are telling you something. Either they don't value expertise (bad client), they're price-shopping (bad fit), or they don't have budget (bad timing). All three are reasons to walk away.

## PART 1: QUALIFICATION GATE

**Who runs it:** Eddie or Emma
**When:** Before committing ANY time beyond an initial call/email
**Time:** 30 minutes max
**Output:** Go / No-go / Park decision

### 1.1 Qualification Scorecard

Score each dimension 1-5. Minimum total score of 15 to proceed. Any single dimension scoring 1 is an automatic Park.

| Dimension | 1 (Poor) | 3 (Acceptable) | 5 (Strong) | Score |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Fit** | Outside CS capability. Would need to sub-contract core work. | Partial fit -- CS can deliver most but would stretch on some elements. | Directly in CS sweet spot: data platforms, integration, applied analytics, AI operationalisation, or strategic advisory. | ___ |
| **Value** | <£20k engagement. One-off project, no follow-on. | £30-80k initial engagement with likely follow-on. | £80k+ or retainer/ongoing relationship. Multi-phase potential. | ___ |
| **Sponsor** | No clear decision-maker identified. Committee/procurement-led. | Decision-maker identified but not yet engaged directly. | Named senior sponsor with budget authority who has expressed need directly. | ___ |
| **Urgency** | "Exploring options." No timeline. No burning platform. | Stated need within 6 months. Some pressure but no hard deadline. | Active pain. Budget allocated. Timeline within 3 months. Something is broken or a strategic initiative is underway. | ___ |
| **Competition** | Incumbent supplier entrenched. Or prospect is price-shopping/benchmarking. | Competitive but CS has a genuine angle (relationship, capability, sector knowledge). | No incumbent. Or incumbent has failed and prospect is actively looking for replacement. Warm introduction or existing relationship. | ___ |

**Total: ___ / 25**

| Score | Decision |
|---|---|
| 20-25 | **Go.** Move to Phase 1 immediately. |
| 15-19 | **Go with conditions.** Proceed but flag the weak dimension. Reassess after Phase 1. |
| 10-14 | **Park.** Not ready. Log it, nurture the relationship, revisit in 3 months. |
| Below 10 | **No-go.** Politely decline or refer. Don't waste time. |

### 1.2 Red Flags -- Stop Before You Start

Any of these present? Do not proceed without discussion with Scott.

- [ ] **No named sponsor.** "The team wants to explore..." means nobody owns the budget.
- [ ] **Procurement-led engagement.** They're column-filling, not buying. You're making up the numbers for the vendor they've already chosen.
- [ ] **"Can you send us a proposal?"** Without a proper conversation first = fishing exercise. Never write a proposal without discovery.
- [ ] **Budget unknown or "TBD."** If they can't tell you the ballpark, they either don't have one or don't trust you enough yet.
- [ ] **Previous supplier "didn't work out" but they can't say why.** The problem is probably the client, not the supplier.
- [ ] **They want a fixed price before understanding scope.** This is a procurement trap. CS does discovery first, then prices.
- [ ] **"We just need someone to build X."** Order-taking engagement. Low margin, low relationship, easy to replace. Unless X is genuinely strategic.
- [ ] **Timeline is "ASAP" but decision process is "we need to get alignment."** Contradiction. Urgency is fake.

## PART 2: PHASE 1 -- LANDSCAPE DISCOVERY

**Who runs it:** Eddie or Emma (with Phil for technical colour if needed)
**When:** After qualification. Before Scott gets involved.
**Sessions:** 1-2 meetings (60-90 mins each) + desk research
**Output:** Completed Landscape Pack (stakeholder map, data landscape canvas, maturity scorecard, pain/opportunity log)

### 2.1 Pre-Meeting Research Checklist

Do this BEFORE the first session. 30-60 minutes of desk research. Show up informed, not ignorant.

**Company & Strategy:**
- [ ] Annual report / investor presentations (public companies) -- what are their stated strategic priorities?
- [ ] Recent press releases -- any digital transformation, new leadership, M&A, restructuring?
- [ ] Company website -- how do they describe themselves? What do they sell? Who are their customers?
- [ ] LinkedIn -- key people, recent hires (are they hiring data/tech roles?), company posts
- [ ] Glassdoor / Indeed -- any signals about internal culture, tech stack, pain points?

**Industry Context:**
- [ ] What are the top 3 data/AI use cases in this sector right now?
- [ ] Who are their main competitors? Are competitors ahead on data/digital?
- [ ] What regulatory or compliance pressures apply? (GDPR, FCA, NHS DSPT, etc.)
- [ ] What does "good" look like for a data-mature organisation in this sector?

**Technology Signals:**
- [ ] Job postings -- what tech stack are they hiring for? (Snowflake, Azure, AWS, Power BI, Tableau, Python, etc.)
- [ ] BuiltWith / Wappalyzer (if applicable) -- web technology signals
- [ ] Any public case studies or conference talks from their tech team?
- [ ] Existing CS relationship -- what do we already know from previous conversations?

**Output:** 1-page brief summarising what you've found. Bring this to Session 1. It shows competence and earns trust immediately.

### 2.2 Stakeholder Map

Fill this in during or immediately after the first session. Ask directly: "Who else needs to be involved in this conversation?"

| Name | Role | Influence | Stance | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ___ | ___ | Decision-maker / Influencer / Blocker / End-user | Champion / Supportive / Neutral / Sceptical / Hostile | ___ |
| ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ |
| ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ |
| ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ |

**Key questions to map stakeholders:**
- "Who signs off on this kind of investment?"
- "Who would be most affected by changes to how you handle data?"
- "Is there anyone else who's been thinking about this problem?"
- "Who tried to solve this before? What happened?"

**Watch for:**
- The IT director who wasn't invited but will veto anything they didn't specify
- The "data champion" who's been fighting this battle alone for 2 years (your best ally)
- The board sponsor who says the right things but won't commit budget or attention

### 2.3 Discovery Session 1: Current State & Pain Points

**Agenda (60-90 minutes):**

**Opening (5 mins):**
- Thank them for their time. Frame the session: "We want to understand where you are today, what's working, and what's getting in the way. This isn't a sales pitch -- it's a diagnostic. By the end, we'll both know whether there's something worth exploring further."

**Their world (20 mins) -- let them talk:**
- "Talk me through your organisation. What does the business do and where is it heading over the next 2-3 years?"
- "Where does data fit into that direction? Is data a strategic priority, or is it more operational?"
- "What prompted this conversation now? What's changed?"

**Data landscape (25 mins) -- structured questions:**
- "Walk me through your data sources. Where does your critical business data live today?"
- "How does data move between systems? Is it automated or manual?"
- "Who are the main consumers of data in the organisation? What do they use it for?"
- "What reporting or analytics do you have today? Who builds it? Who trusts it?"
- "Where are the biggest data quality issues? What breaks, gets duplicated, or goes missing?"
- "Do you have a data warehouse or data platform? If so, what's the technology? How old is it?"

**Technology estate (15 mins):**
- "What are your core business systems?" (ERP, CRM, HRIS, finance, ecommerce, bespoke)
- "Where are you hosted? Cloud, on-prem, hybrid?"
- "Do you have a data or BI team? How many people? What skills?"
- "What tools do they use?" (ETL tools, BI tools, languages, cloud services)

**Pain points (15 mins) -- the money questions:**
- "What's the most frustrating data problem you face today?"
- "What decisions are you making without good data that you wish you had?"
- "What's this costing you? Not precisely -- but is this a £10k problem, a £100k problem, or a £1M problem?"
- "Have you tried to fix this before? What happened?"
- "If you could change one thing about how your organisation uses data, what would it be?"

**Close (5 mins):**
- Summarise what you've heard (reflect it back -- builds trust and checks understanding)
- "Based on what you've shared, I think there are some real opportunities here. I'd like to bring in our technical lead [Scott] to go deeper on the strategic side. Would that be useful?"
- Agree next steps and timeline

### 2.5 Data Maturity Assessment

Simple 5-level model. Score each dimension based on the conversation. This is not an audit -- it's a diagnostic conversation tool.

| Dimension | 1: Ad Hoc | 2: Aware | 3: Defined | 4: Managed | 5: Optimised | Score |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Data Strategy** | No strategy. Data is a byproduct, not an asset. | Some awareness that data matters. No formal plan. | Written data strategy aligned to business goals. Roadmap exists. | Strategy actively executed. Regular review. Data investment prioritised. | Data strategy embedded in business strategy. Data-driven culture. | ___ |
| **Data Architecture** | Data scattered. No platform. Spreadsheets and emails. | Some central storage. Data warehouse maybe, but legacy or underused. | Modern data platform (cloud). Defined architecture. Data flows designed. | Scalable architecture. Well-governed. Supports analytics and AI. | Real-time capable. Self-service. Automated pipelines. Event-driven. | ___ |
| **Data Quality** | Nobody knows what's accurate. Duplicate, missing, inconsistent. | Known quality issues. Some manual cleaning. Reactive fixes. | Quality rules defined. Some automated validation. Ownership assigned. | Continuous quality monitoring. Automated remediation. Metrics tracked. | Proactive quality management. Data contracts. Trust is high. | ___ |
| **Analytics & BI** | Manual reporting. Spreadsheet-based. Inconsistent numbers. | Some dashboards. Multiple versions of truth. Analyst-dependent. | Central BI platform. Governed metrics. Self-service for basics. | Advanced analytics. Predictive capability. Embedded in decision-making. | AI/ML in production. Prescriptive analytics. Continuous improvement. | ___ |
| **Data Governance** | No governance. No ownership. No policies. | Some awareness. Maybe a data owner in IT. Informal policies. | Formal governance framework. Data owners. Policies documented. | Active governance. Stewardship in place. Compliance automated. | Governance embedded in culture. Self-regulating. Privacy by design. | ___ |
| **People & Skills** | No dedicated data team. IT manages everything. | Small data/BI team. Skills concentrated in 1-2 people. | Defined data team. Range of skills. Some training. | Strong data team. Data literacy across org. Investment in skills. | Data skills embedded org-wide. Innovation culture. Attract top talent. | ___ |

**Total: ___ / 30**

| Score | Maturity Stage | What it means for CS |
|---|---|---|
| 6-10 | **Foundation** | Client needs the basics: platform, governance, initial BI. Long engagement, high value. Phase-based approach. |
| 11-15 | **Developing** | Some foundations in place but gaps. Targeted intervention -- probably platform modernisation or governance. |
| 16-20 | **Established** | Solid base. Looking for next level -- advanced analytics, AI/ML, optimisation. Higher sophistication engagement. |
| 21-25 | **Advanced** | Strong data capability. Looking for edge cases, innovation, or scaling challenges. Niche, high-value. |
| 26-30 | **Leading** | They probably don't need CS for fundamentals. Advisory only, or very specific capability injection. |

### 2.6 Phase 1 Output: Landscape Pack

Before handing off to Scott, compile:

1. **Qualification scorecard** (completed)
2. **Pre-meeting research brief** (1 page)
3. **Stakeholder map** (completed)
4. **Data landscape canvas** (completed)
5. **Data maturity scorecard** (completed)
6. **Pain/opportunity log** -- bullet list of stated pain points and any opportunities spotted
7. **Recommendation to Scott:** "Here's what we found. Here's what we think the opportunity is. Here's what we need you to explore."

**Handoff meeting with Scott: 30 minutes.** Walk through the pack. Scott decides whether to proceed to Phase 2 and what to focus on.

---

## PART 3: PHASE 2 -- STRATEGIC DISCOVERY

**Who runs it:** Scott (with team member for notes and continuity)
**When:** After reviewing the Landscape Pack from Phase 1
**Sessions:** 1-2 meetings (90-120 mins each) with senior stakeholders
**Output:** Strategic opportunity map, architecture vision, commercial framing

### 3.1 Preparing for Phase 2

Review the Landscape Pack and answer:
- What's the real problem here? (Often different from the stated problem)
- Where is the business value? Not data value -- business value.
- What's the quickest win that builds trust and funds the bigger work?
- What does the target architecture look like? (High-level, not detailed design)
- Who do I need in the room?

### 3.2 Strategic Discovery Session Agenda

**This is not a requirements-gathering session. It's a diagnostic.**

The team gathered the symptoms in Phase 1. Scott's job is to diagnose the underlying condition and prescribe the treatment. Frame it that way.

**Opening (10 mins):**
- "My team has spent time understanding your current landscape and I've reviewed everything. I have a good picture of where you are. Today I want to understand where you're trying to get to and what's in the way -- so we can give you an honest view of what's possible, what it takes, and whether we're the right people to help."

**Business Strategy Alignment (20 mins):**
- "What are the top 3 strategic priorities for the business over the next 2-3 years?"
- "Which of those is most dependent on data or technology?"
- "Where is the business losing money, time, or competitive position because of how data works today?"
- "Is there a board-level conversation about data or digital? What's the expectation?"
- "What does success look like for you personally in 12 months?"

**Diagnostic Observations (20 mins) -- this is where Scott adds value:**

Present observations from the Landscape Pack as insights, not just findings. This is the Challenger moment -- teach them something about their own business.

- "Based on what my team found, here's what I'm seeing..." (3-4 key observations)
- "The pattern I see in organisations at your stage is..." (normalise, then challenge)
- "The risk of doing nothing is..." (quantify if possible)
- "The thing that would make the biggest difference is..." (lead with your diagnosis)

**Watch their reaction.** If they lean in, you're on the right track. If they push back, probe why -- they either disagree (good -- you'll learn something) or they're not ready to hear it (flag for later).

**Architecture Vision (20 mins):**
- Whiteboard the current state (from Phase 1 canvas) and the target state
- "Here's where you are. Here's where you need to be. Here's the gap."
- Sketch the high-level technical approach (not detailed design -- directional)
- Technologies: be specific. "Snowflake on AWS" not "a modern data platform." Specificity builds credibility.
- "This is achievable in [timeframe] with [approach]."

**Opportunity Prioritisation (15 mins):**
- Present 3-5 opportunities identified from Phase 1 + your analysis
- Prioritise together with the client using the matrix in 3.3
- Agree on what "Phase 1 of the engagement" looks like -- the quick win that proves value

**Commercial Framing (10 mins):**
- "Based on everything we've discussed, here's how I'd suggest we approach this."
- Structure: Discovery output (paid) --> Phase 1 delivery (quick win) --> Ongoing phases
- Don't quote fees in the room. Say: "I'll come back with a detailed proposal and investment case. But directionally, for this type of work, you should expect [range]."
- "What's your timeline for making a decision?"
- "What does your approval process look like?"

**Close (5 mins):**
- Confirm next steps: proposal timeline, who sees it, decision process
- "Is there anything else I should know before I write this up?"

### 3.3 Opportunity Prioritisation Matrix

Use this with the client in the room. Whiteboard it. Let them place the opportunities.

```
                        HIGH IMPACT
                            |
                            |
         QUICK WINS         |        STRATEGIC BETS
         (Do first)         |        (Plan for Phase 2+)
                            |
   LOW EFFORT ------------- + ------------- HIGH EFFORT
                            |
         FILL-INS           |        DEPRIORITISE
         (Do if capacity)   |        (Don't invest now)
                            |
                        LOW IMPACT
```

For each opportunity, capture:

| # | Opportunity | Impact (H/M/L) | Effort (H/M/L) | Quadrant | Estimated value | Dependencies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ |
| 2 | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ |
| 3 | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ |
| 4 | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ |
| 5 | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ |

**Impact = business value** (revenue, cost saving, risk reduction, strategic positioning)
**Effort = total investment** (time, technology, change management, data quality remediation)

### 3.4 Industry-Specific Discovery Guidance

What to look for and where the value typically sits, by sector.

**Manufacturing:**
- Supply chain visibility and demand forecasting (high value, common pain)
- Predictive maintenance / IoT data integration
- Production quality analytics
- ERP integration (SAP/Oracle to modern analytics stack)
- Watch for: massive legacy ERP dependency, IT team that "has it covered," data siloed in operational systems

**Financial Services:**
- Regulatory reporting automation (cost of compliance is a reliable pain point)
- Customer analytics / segmentation / lifetime value
- Risk modelling and fraud detection
- Data lineage and governance (regulatory requirement, not optional)
- Watch for: incumbent big-4 consultancies, heavy compliance culture, long procurement cycles

**Healthcare / Life Sciences:**
- Patient data integration across systems (EPR, PAS, community, social care)
- Operational efficiency (bed management, clinic utilisation, workforce planning)
- Research data platforms
- Watch for: NHS procurement rules, information governance complexity, data sharing agreements, long sales cycles

**Public Sector:**
- Service delivery efficiency and demand prediction
- Data sharing across agencies
- Fraud and error detection (benefits, grants, tax)
- Compliance and transparency
- Watch for: procurement frameworks (G-Cloud, DOS), decision by committee, political sensitivity, budget cycles

**Retail / Ecommerce:**
- Customer 360 / single customer view
- Demand forecasting and inventory optimisation
- Personalisation and recommendation
- Omnichannel data integration
- Watch for: fast-moving, expect quick results, high data volumes, multiple platforms generating data

### 3.5 Phase 2 Output

Scott produces (or directs the team to produce):

1. **Strategic opportunity assessment** -- what we found, what it means, what to do about it
2. **Prioritised opportunity list** -- from the matrix session
3. **High-level architecture vision** -- current state, target state, gap
4. **Commercial framing notes** -- engagement structure, approximate sizing, timeline
5. **Proposal brief** -- enough for Emma/Eddie to draft the formal proposal with Scott's review

---

## PART 4: DISCOVERY OUTPUT -- WHAT THE CLIENT RECEIVES

### 4.1 Discovery Report Structure

The discovery report is the primary deliverable of a paid discovery engagement (see Tier structure above). It demonstrates rigour and separates CS from competitors who just send quotes. The depth and length scales with the tier -- 3-5 pages for Tier 1, 10-15 for Tier 2, 20+ for Tier 3.

**Report structure:**

```
DISCOVERY REPORT

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (1 page)
   - What we found
   - What we recommend
   - What it's worth to you
   - What it takes

2. CURRENT STATE ASSESSMENT (2-3 pages)
   - Data landscape summary (from canvas)
   - Technology estate overview
   - Data maturity profile (from scorecard)
   - Key findings and observations

3. OPPORTUNITIES IDENTIFIED (2-3 pages)
   - Prioritised list with impact/effort assessment

### 4.2 Roadmap Format

Phased, pragmatic, 12-18 month horizon. Not a Gantt chart -- a strategic direction with clear stages.

```
PHASE 1 (Months 1-3): FOUNDATION
"Get the basics right"
- [Specific deliverables]
- [Quick win that proves value]
- Investment: £XX,XXX
- Success measure: [specific, measurable]

PHASE 2 (Months 4-8): BUILD
"Deliver the core platform"
- [Specific deliverables]
- Investment: £XX,XXX
- Success measure: [specific, measurable]

PHASE 3 (Months 9-12+): SCALE
"Extend and optimise"
- [Specific deliverables]
- Investment: £XX,XXX
- Success measure: [specific, measurable]

ONGOING: SUPPORT & EVOLVE
- Managed service / retainer
- Investment: £X,XXX/month
```

### 4.3 Investment Case Framework

Always frame the investment against the cost of inaction. The client is not choosing between "spend money with CS" and "spend nothing." They're choosing between "solve the problem" and "keep paying the cost of the problem."

| Element | Description |
|---|---|
| **Cost of the problem** | What is this data/technology gap costing the business today? (Manual effort, errors, missed opportunities, compliance risk, competitive disadvantage) |
| **Proposed investment** | CS engagement: phased, with clear deliverables per phase. Total and per-phase. |
| **Expected return** | What does the client gain? Quantify: time saved, cost reduced, revenue enabled, risk mitigated. |
| **Payback period** | When does the investment start paying for itself? Aim for <12 months on Phase 1. |
| **Risk of inaction** | What happens if they do nothing? Competitors pull ahead, compliance risk grows, manual costs compound, key person dependency deepens. |

## PART 5: EXAMPLE OUTPUTS

### 5.1 Example: Completed Qualification Scorecard

```
OPPORTUNITY: Data Platform Modernisation
DATE: 10 February 2026
QUALIFIED BY: Eddie

COMPANY: Precision Components Ltd
SECTOR: Manufacturing (automotive parts)
SIZE: ~400 employees / £45M revenue
SOURCE: Referral from Danny (AWMM network)

CONTACT: Sarah Chen
ROLE: Head of Operations
DECISION AUTHORITY: Influencer (budget sits with CFO, James Hartley)

STATED NEED: "We've got data everywhere but can't get a single view of
production performance. Our ERP is 15 years old, reporting is all Excel,
and we've just lost our only analyst. The board wants better visibility
but we don't know where to start."

QUALIFICATION SCORES:
  Fit:         5  (Data platform + analytics + integration = CS sweet spot)
  Value:       4  (Likely £60-100k initial engagement, ongoing potential)
  Sponsor:     3  (Head of Ops is engaged but CFO is the decision-maker,
                    not yet in the conversation)
  Urgency:     4  (Lost their analyst, board pressure, genuine pain.
                    But no hard deadline yet.)
  Competition: 4  (No incumbent data partner. Warm referral.
                    They'll probably talk to 1-2 others.)

TOTAL: 20 / 25
DECISION: Go
CONDITIONS: Need to get CFO (James Hartley) into the conversation by
end of Phase 1. Without him, this stalls at proposal stage.

NOTES: Strong opportunity. Classic manufacturing data problem. Sarah is
the champion -- she's been fighting for this for 2 years. Board mandate
gives it legs. Main risk is CFO engagement and whether they'll invest
properly or want it done on the cheap.

### 5.2 Example: Discovery Report Executive Summary

```
DISCOVERY REPORT: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Precision Components Ltd | March 2026

WHAT WE FOUND

Precision Components operates on a 15-year-old ERP system with critical
production, quality, and financial data locked in silos. Reporting is
entirely manual -- your operations team spends an estimated 35 hours per
week compiling spreadsheets that are out of date by the time they reach
the board. You have no single version of the truth for production
performance, quality metrics, or customer delivery accuracy.

Your data maturity score is 8/30 (Foundation stage). This is not unusual
for a manufacturer of your size, but it means you are making strategic
decisions -- including capacity planning, supplier negotiation, and
customer commitments -- on incomplete and often contradictory information.

WHAT WE RECOMMEND

A three-phase programme to build a modern data platform on Snowflake
(AWS-hosted), automate your critical data pipelines from SAP and your
quality management system, and deliver Power BI dashboards for
production performance, quality, and financial reporting.

Phase 1 (3 months, £45,000): Foundation -- data platform, core pipelines,
production performance dashboard. Immediate win: eliminate the manual
weekly reporting cycle and give the board real-time production visibility.

Phase 2 (4 months, £55,000): Build -- quality analytics, supplier
performance, customer delivery tracking. Predictive capability for
demand forecasting.

Phase 3 (ongoing, £4,000/month): Support, optimise, extend. New data
sources, advanced analytics, team enablement.

WHAT IT'S WORTH

Conservative estimate: £120-180k annual value through reduced manual
effort (£60k), improved production scheduling (£40-80k through reduced
waste and overtime), and better supplier negotiation leverage (£20-40k).
Phase 1 pays for itself within 6 months.

WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DO NOTHING

You continue making decisions on stale spreadsheets. Your next analyst
hire inherits the same broken process. Your competitors -- who are
investing in this capability -- gain visibility you don't have. And the
board's frustration doesn't go away; it escalates.
