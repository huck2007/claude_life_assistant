# AWMM — Roadmap & Budget Update
**February 2026**

---

## January Review

### Delivery Summary

| Project | Status |
|---------|--------|
| CRISP (Customer Service Automation) | Live — public website and all email inboxes |
| Gold Club Only Race Draws | Complete and live |
| Snowflake Platform Refactor & Upgrade | In progress — on track for go-live end of Feb |
| Six Star Social Widget | Carried forward — pending design work |
| Shopify Tax Setup | Complete (with Florian and tax advisors) |
| Shopify Fulfilment & Logistics Transition | Complete (new partner onboarded) |
| TCS Project Collaboration | Promising discussions — awaiting contract progression |

**Note:** Shopify support for Kelly's team required significantly more involvement than planned across both tax setup and fulfilment transition, resulting in 5.5 days over budget. We are discussing with Kelly how to account for this.

### January Budget

| Workstream | Budget | Actual | Variance |
|------------|-------:|-------:|---------:|
| Development Retainer | £8,570 | £7,229 | +£1,341 |
| Gold Club Only Race Draws | £8,570 | £8,343 | +£227 |
| Shopify Store | £2,000 | £7,527 | -£5,527 |
| Strategic Services | £2,063 | £4,125 | -£2,062 |
| Support & Maintenance | £5,938 | £7,077 | -£1,139 |
| **Total** | **£27,141** | **£34,301** | **-£7,160** |

The overrun was driven primarily by Shopify (tax and fulfilment complexity) and Strategic Services. Project retainer and Gold Club came in under budget.

## February Plan

**Monthly Budget:** £18,571

### Project Focus

| Project | Budget Allocation | Notes |
|---------|------------------:|-------|
| GRC Monthly Roundup Messaging | 15 days | Main development focus for the month |
| CookiePro → OneTrust/ConsentPro Upgrade | 4 days | Essential — CookiePro is being deprecated |
| Platinum Club: Initial Design & Planning | 6 days | Scoping and design ahead of full kick-off post-Tokyo (early March) |
| CRISP go-live on Shopify store | — | Completion; need to disuss next phase and re-enabling AI Automation |
| Snowflake Refactor & Upgrade | — | Completion |
| Six Star Social Widget | — | Go-live |

### Budget Outlook

GRC Monthly Roundup and the CookiePro upgrade will consume the February development retainer and use most of March allocation.

We have transitioned to an **annual retainer model** to accommodate this higher near-term burn rate. Monthly billing for the standard project retainer remains at a flat £8,570/month throughout the year. This provides flexibility to front-load effort where needed, though we will need to monitor cumulative usage against the annual envelope to prevent a budget overrun on the standard project retainer.

Platinum club has a separate budget allocated, and we will continue to monitor carefully and report to you monthly.
