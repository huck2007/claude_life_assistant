## Research to Complete Before Next Conversation

### Digital Twin / 3D Capture
- [ ] Understand iPhone LiDAR landscape (Polycam, Canvas, Matterport) vs Omniverse - confirmed these are complementary, not competing. Capture vs simulation/orchestration. Ben's partner likely using photogrammetry/LiDAR capture at a fraction of the Omniverse cost
- [ ] Clarify what the US road scanning/mapping company does and how it fits (ask Ben)

### Data Standards
- [ ] Understand relevant standards for the compliance platform data model:
  - **Uniclass** - UK's primary classification system for built environment (mandated in UK BIM projects)
  - **IFC (Industry Foundation Classes)** - open format for exchanging BIM models between platforms
  - **COBie** - structured data format for asset handover to FM/operations (filtered view of IFC)
  - **ISO 19650** - international standard for information management using BIM (replaced old BIM Level 2)
  - **Gemini Principles** - nine principles for national digital twins (purpose, trust, function)
- [ ] Consider how the compliance orchestration platform aligns with or leverages these standards
- [ ] Explore whether standards alignment strengthens the IP/patent conversation

### Government Initiatives
- [ ] **National Digital Twin Programme (NDTP)** - active, governed by Dept for Business and Trade. Active demonstrators in energy, incident management, emergency planning
- [ ] **Connected Places Catapult** - hosts the Digital Twin Hub (3,500+ members). Took over from CDBB
- [ ] **Digital Catapult / UK Digital Twin Centre** - opened Belfast May 2025
- [ ] Explore whether any of these programmes offer partnership or validation opportunities beyond pure funding

### Funding Opportunities
- [ ] **Digital Catapult - Digital Twin Adoption Accelerator**: grants up to 100k + mentorship. Programme starts January 2026 - check if still open or next round
- [ ] **Digital Catapult - Digital Twin Academic R&D Accelerator**: up to 225k + expert support
- [ ] **Digital Catapult - Digital Twin SME Network**: tech SMEs in data services, integration, intelligence. Could be a route to market as well as funding
- [ ] **Innovate UK Growth Catalyst (Round 2)**: up to 900k grant, but requires aligned VC investment (seed to Series A). Grant conditional on investor providing equity. Could dovetail with Ben's VC conversations
- [ ] **Knowledge Transfer Partnerships (KTPs)**: part-funded graduate placement for innovation projects. Could fund developer resource
- [ ] **DRIVE35 Innovation Fund**: digital transformation in manufacturing including AI, digital twins, IoT. Share of up to 4.7m
- [ ] **EIS/SEIS**: remind Ben that his investors get 30% income tax relief + CGT exemption. Extended to April 2035

### Key Point on Grants + VC
- Innovate UK grants are **non-dilutive** (no equity taken)
- Can combine grants with VC funding (no double-funding on same activity, but R&D grant + commercial VC works)
- Grant backing is a credibility signal for VCs
- Growth Catalyst specifically designed to pair grant + VC

## Strategic Questions for CS

- [ ] What role does CS want here? Paid build partner, fractional CTO, equity stakeholder, or some combination?
- [ ] If POC is funded, what's the realistic team and timeline? Can we deliver with AI-assisted development or do we need to bring in a developer?
- [ ] Is there a KTP opportunity to embed a graduate developer on the project (part-funded)?
- [ ] Does CS want to invest capital alongside providing services? If so, how much and at what terms?
