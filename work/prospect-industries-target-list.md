## Industry 1: Specialist Insurance & Underwriting

**Why this industry:** Mid-sized MGAs and niche underwriters generate enormous volumes of claims, pricing, exposure, and broker performance data, but much of it is trapped in legacy policy admin systems and spreadsheets. The sector is moving toward algorithmic underwriting and real-time portfolio analytics, but mid-sized players lack the data engineering capability to build the platforms that make this possible.

1. **Sabre Insurance Group plc** — Specialist motor insurer (car, van, motorbike). LSE-listed. GWP ~£225m. Headquartered in Dorking, Surrey. Sells through 1,000+ brokers plus direct brands (Go Girl, Insure 2 Drive). *Data opportunity:* Proprietary pricing model and expanding underwriting dataset recently migrated to CDL. A unified platform connecting pricing models, claims experience, broker performance, and enrichment data could unlock granular risk segmentation and real-time portfolio steering.

2. **ERS Insurance** — UK's largest specialist motor insurer at Lloyd's. GWP exceeding £500m. Covers niche segments including supercars, classic cars, commercial fleet, agricultural vehicles. 75+ years of underwriting history. *Data opportunity:* Decades of specialist motor claims and underwriting data across 20+ product lines, much manually underwritten. Stated ambition to grow through AI and digitalisation — connecting fragmented product-line data into a single analytics platform would enable cross-portfolio insights and predictive loss modelling.

3. **MX Underwriting** — Fast-growing MGA launched 2021 by Specialist Risk Group. Approaching £200m GWP across UK and Europe. 120+ underwriters covering renewables, M&A, real estate, environmental risk. *Data opportunity:* Scaling rapidly through acquisition but still in formative years technologically. Opportunity to build a unified underwriting data platform from the ground up — connecting disparate teams, capacity providers, and broker channels before legacy fragmentation sets in.

## Industry 2: Food & Drink Manufacturing

**Why this industry:** UK's largest manufacturing sector (£104bn), yet mid-sized producers are notoriously behind on data maturity. Production data in ERP systems, demand planning in spreadsheets, supply chain visibility limited, quality/compliance data in standalone systems. Rich operational data — batch production, yield, waste, demand patterns, supplier performance, nutritional compliance — rarely unified into anything actionable.

1. **Nichols plc** — Maker of Vimto. LSE-listed, Newton-le-Willows, Merseyside. Revenue £172.8m (2024). Hybrid model across packaged retail, dispensed/on-trade, and international licensing. *Data opportunity:* Each division has different supply chains, demand patterns, and channel economics. Warehousing distributed across multiple third-party sites. A unified commercial data platform connecting demand signals, channel performance, franchise/licensing data, and production planning could drive margin optimisation across a business that has outgrown its mid-sized systems.

2. **Finsbury Food Group** — One of the UK's largest speciality bakery manufacturers (cakes, bread, bakery snacks). Revenue £452.4m (FY2024). Recently transitioned from public to private ownership. Multiple production sites. *Data opportunity:* Implemented common ERP (Infor M3) and AI-driven demand forecasting (RELEX), but acknowledged "reliance on legacy planning tools and spreadsheets persisted." Grown through acquisition — each site still operates with varying data maturity. New private owners need commercial intelligence to drive integration.

3. **Apetito Ltd** — Prepared meals for hospitals, care homes, schools, meals-on-wheels. Plus Wiltshire Farm Foods D2C brand. Turnover £259.5m (2024). 47 million meals/year from Trowbridge. 1,900 employees. *Data opportunity:* Goldmine of nutritional, dietary, delivery logistics, and customer/patient outcome data. Already use Power BI, Azure, and Python. Opportunity: unified platform connecting meal production, nutritional compliance, delivery routing, and patient outcomes — transforming from food manufacturer into nutrition-as-a-service platform.

## Industry 3: Freight & Logistics

**Why this industry:** Mid-sized operators generate vast data — route telemetry, fleet performance, warehouse throughput, delivery confirmation, driver behaviour — but 82.6% report technology challenges impacting operations, and 37% cite outdated systems as primary barrier. Sector runs on a patchwork of TMS, WMS, and ERP systems that rarely talk to each other. Thin margins mean operators who can turn operational data into optimisation and insight will win.

1. **Kinaxia Logistics** — 13 businesses covering warehousing, haulage, contract packing, freight forwarding, e-fulfilment, 2-person delivery. Turnover £199.4m (2024). Macclesfield. Recently announced "multimillion-pound investment in technology." *Data opportunity:* 13 acquisitions, each with own systems. Explicitly stated technology/digital transformation as strategic priority. Opportunity: group-wide operational data platform unifying fleet, warehouse, and customer data across all 13 businesses.

2. **Pall-Ex Group** — UK's leading palletised freight distribution network. 40,000+ pallets daily. Turnover ~£92m. Three UK hubs. Uses proprietary IT system "Nexus" for member network coordination. *Data opportunity:* Coordinates a network of independent haulier members, generating massive routing, consignment tracking, and delivery data. Nexus handles transactions but analytics layer is the gap — turning network performance data into predictive demand modelling, route optimisation, and member benchmarking. Classic "transaction system to intelligence platform" play.

3. **Howard Tenens Logistics** — Independently owned. Revenue £128.8m (2024). Operations across Gloucestershire, Somerset, Lincolnshire, Manchester, Leicestershire. Serves automotive, retail, FMCG, food & drink, renewable energy. *Data opportunity:* Traditional logistics business facing first decline in turnover since 2012. A platform connecting warehouse throughput, transport utilisation, customer service metrics, and sector-level demand trends could provide the commercial intelligence to reverse decline and identify margin opportunities across their diversified client base.

## Industry 4: Waste & Environmental Services

**Why this industry:** UK waste sector is at a regulatory inflection point. Mandatory digital waste tracking being rolled out. ESG reporting, carbon accounting, and circular economy metrics becoming table stakes for contracts. Operators collect enormous operational data — routes, tonnages, contamination rates, recycling yields, compliance, environmental monitoring — but most lives in standalone systems or paper records. Companies that can platform this data will command premium contracts.

1. **Grundon Waste Management** — UK's largest family-owned waste management company. Turnover ~£156m (2023). 900+ employees, 15,000+ organisations served. Operates materials recycling, hazardous waste landfill, energy-from-waste across southern England. *Data opportunity:* 90+ years of operational data, environmental monitoring, compliance documentation. Recycling facilities recover 95-98% of paper/card — operational excellence buried in facility-level reporting. Unified platform connecting collection, yields, carbon metrics, and client compliance reporting would position them as data-led leader in the mandatory waste tracking era.

2. **Renewi plc (UK operations)** — Waste-to-product specialist. UK revenue ~£166m. Long-term local authority MSW contracts, anaerobic digestion, lower-carbon fuel production. Recently acquired by Macquarie/BCI consortium for £707m. *Data opportunity:* Circular economy model generates rich material flow data — what enters as waste, what exits as product. Under new PE ownership, pressure to demonstrate value creation is intense. A platform connecting waste input data, processing yields, material output quality, and carbon offset metrics would give owners visibility into circular economy performance.

3. **Adler & Allan** — Environmental risk reduction services. Revenue ~£60-75m. 587 employees, Harrogate. Three divisions: Environmental, Energy, Water. Recently acquired by Goldman Sachs Alternatives. *Data opportunity:* Manages environmental risk across fuel storage, water treatment, contaminated land, energy infrastructure — generating compliance, incident, monitoring, and asset condition data across hundreds of sites. Under GS PE ownership, mandate is to scale. A unified environmental risk data platform would transform field-services into platform-enabled environmental intelligence.

## Industry 5: Private Healthcare & Diagnostics

**Why this industry:** The independent healthcare sector is data-rich but platform-poor. Diagnostic providers generate millions of imaging studies, pathology results, and clinical assessments annually. Data sits in clinical systems (PACS, RIS, PAS) designed for individual patient care, not population analytics or operational intelligence. NHS backlog crisis is driving demand for independent capacity — providers who can demonstrate outcomes and value through data will win contracts. PE investors (who own most of the sector) are hungry for data platforms that demonstrate portfolio value.

1. **InHealth Group** — UK's largest specialist diagnostic services provider. 300+ sites. Revenue ~£305m (2023). Acquired by KKR for ~£500m. Delivers MRI, CT, PET-CT, mammography, ultrasound, endoscopy, audiology to 1m+ patients/year. Operates Community Diagnostic Centres for 13+ NHS partners. *Data opportunity:* 1m+ diagnostic events/year across 300+ sites, structured for clinical reporting not operational analytics. A platform connecting diagnostic volumes, wait times, outcomes, equipment utilisation, and patient pathways would give KKR portfolio intelligence and position InHealth to sell data-driven capacity planning as a service.

2. **Medica Group** — UK's leading teleradiology provider. 2m+ clinical reports/year. Revenue ~£50-55m. Acquired by IK Partners for £269m. Works with ~100 NHS trusts. 750+ radiologists across 20 countries. *Data opportunity:* 2m+ imaging reports creating a unique dataset of turnaround times, clinical complexity, radiologist performance, and demand patterns across 100+ trusts. Analytics layer is nascent. Platform turning reporting data into trust-level benchmarking, demand forecasting, and workforce planning would transform a reporting service into a radiology intelligence platform.

3. **Ramsay Health Care UK** — 36 private hospitals. UK revenue ~£208-250m. ~80% revenue from NHS contracts. Part of global Ramsay group. *Data opportunity:* 36 hospitals generating surgical, diagnostic, and patient pathway data — must increasingly demonstrate outcomes and value to commissioners. Platform connecting clinical outcomes, theatre utilisation, waiting times, and cost-per-procedure across all 36 facilities would help win NHS contracts and give the Australian parent group-level visibility.
