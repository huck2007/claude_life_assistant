Hi Ben,

Great to meet you today - really interesting problem.

Wanted to drop you a note while it's fresh to confirm my understanding and flag a few things worth discussing next time we talk.

**My understanding of what you're building:**

A unified compliance orchestration platform. Middleware that sits across existing source systems and gives a single compliance view. Two-way integration: not just reading data but writing back, triggering work orders, updating records, closing the loop. The platform is the connective tissue, not a replacement for what's already there. And once you've got that unified data layer, the opportunities open up beyond compliance: activating that data for operational decision-making, streamlining compliance reporting, and building out risk analytics across the estate.

I noted down 5 domain areas:

1. Equipment/plant telemetry - IoT/sensor data, real-time capture, threshold alerts
2. CAFM/maintenance compliance - SFG20 schedules, planned preventive maintenance
3. Assessment tracking - possibly a sub-module of CAFM rather than standalone, but listed separately for now
4. Health & safety - ISO 45001, incident management, behavioural safety
5. BIM - 3D spatial model with assets mapped

Let me know if I've got those wrong or missed any nuance.

**Technology partners:**

You mentioned a couple of other technologies in the mix that are worth flagging. First, using iPhone photogrammetry to capture building interiors for the digital twin, which brings the cost of building the 3D model right down and accelerates that part of the process significantly. You have a partner with the technology and the visualisation capability for this. Second, you mentioned a company in the US with technology for scanning and mapping roads and infrastructure. I'll be honest, I didn't fully follow that one, so it would be good to hear more about how that fits into the overall picture. I get the sense that partnerships are a critical part of how you see this scaling beyond the POC. It would be worth diving deeper into what that looks like in practice, whether you're thinking technology partners, implementation partners, or both.

**Where CS fits:**

The integration and data architecture layer is core to what we do. Connecting disparate systems, normalising data into a domain model, and building intelligence on top. I've done some noodling around / research and it seems nobody in the market is genuinely positioning as middleware; everyone's trying to be the system of record through acquisition. The big players are focused on their enterprise clients and even with that investment they're still failing to close the gap between siloed products. That's the risk for them and the opportunity for you.

**On approach:**

As I mentioned today, my instinct is don't try to boil the ocean on a prototype. Pick one customer site, two complementary domains, and prove the middleware works end to end, including the write-back. If we can show cross-domain intelligence triggering actions back into a source system, that demonstrates the architecture scales without building everything at once.

You'll know better than me which two domains are the killer combination, the ones that prove the concept and generate the most interest from buyers / investors.  Worth thinking about which pairing you'd lead with.

**A few things I'd like to explore next time we speak:**

1. Do you have access to a live site with real source systems we could build a POC against, or are we working from specifications at this stage?  Maybe we can spin up a couple of trial / open source systems in the domains you suggest and load them with synthetic data?
2. On the commercial side, the POC has real build costs regardless of approach. How are you thinking about funding that phase? Understanding that helps me shape what's realistic.
3. Beyond the POC, what does the overarching timeline look like? Phase 1 delivery, raising further finance, then scaling to the full platform. Be good to understand how you see those phases fitting together, especially with June as your start point.
4. What's your longer term vision for this, where do you want it to be in 3 to 5 years, and do you have an exit strategy in mind?
5. Have you thought about IP protection? Is there anything patentable in the orchestration layer or the domain model?   Probably not, but worth asking as you know the space better than I do.
6. Have you explored grant-aided funding? With AI in the mix and a genuine industry advancement angle, there could be innovation funding available. Worth understanding how that sits alongside the VC conversation.

More generally, I'm sure I've missed things or oversimplified in places. Be good if you could fill in the blanks on anything I've got wrong or left out.

Happy to jump on a call whenever suits, or you're welcome to come over to our offices in Stockton Heath (Bruntwood, near Morrisons) if you'd prefer to do it face to face.
