# Email 1: To Phil V (CTO) — Follow-up & Clarification Request

**Subject:** Follow-up from our conversation — Data & Cloud Ops Optimisation

Phil,

Good to speak earlier — appreciate the transparency on where this is heading.

I want to make sure I'm fully across what's being proposed so I can give you a considered view rather than a reactive one. To that end, could you confirm the following:

1. **What exactly is Future Processing offering?** Is this a managed service, a procurement intermediary, a consulting engagement, or something else? I'd like to understand the specific "product" and how it's being positioned.
2. **What's the scope?** Are we talking about AWS cost optimisation only, or does this extend to Snowflake, security, architecture, or operational management?
3. **What's the ask of us?** Will we be asked to hand over access, share configurations, transition operational responsibility, or simply collaborate on a review?

For context, we currently operate and maintain three AWS sub-accounts (dev/uat/prod) and three Snowflake accounts (dev/uat/prod). We negotiated the Snowflake contract and secured a significant discount directly. On the AWS side, there are savings plan options we could invoke but haven't yet been given the green light to pursue.

I want to be helpful here, not obstructive. But I need to understand the full picture before I can give you an honest assessment of whether this adds value or introduces risk.

Happy to jump on a call once you have the detail.

Best,
Scott
