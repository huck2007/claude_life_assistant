## Working — double down

1. **Morning rituals are bulletproof.** Near-perfect across all 4 weeks. Even on travel/disruption days, partial routines maintained. No longer willpower — identity.

2. **Physical health is the proof of concept.** Gym 3x/week for nearly 2 years. Running with Sophie. 20kg down. Badminton emerging. When pointing to evidence that systems work, this is it.

3. **Recovery speed.** Jan 21 write-off, Jan 22 bounce-back. No spiralling. Trained skill.

4. **Delegation moving in right direction.** Jan 22: three problems delegated, all resolved. Dashboard built by Eddie. Marketing brief with Emma. Impower estimate done. Pattern exists — question is whether it's accelerating or plateauing.

5. **OYTS journaling quality.** Connected insights across weeks, honest self-assessment, genuine depth. Engine of the whole system.

6. **Weekend boundaries holding.** Family time protected. Cinema, Burns Night, walks, presence. Goal met.

## Course correct

1. **Hydration is the dumbest bottleneck in the system.** Cascade identified: hydration -> sleep -> rituals -> command -> doubt recedes. Scores across 4 weeks: almost entirely O and B. Not a single G or Gr. Highest ROI change available. Hasn't been fixed despite being perfectly articulated.

2. **Mobility quietly dropped.** Week 4: blank every day. Deferred since w/c 19 Jan. Either do it or remove it from the tracker. A daily reminder of something not being done is worse than either option.

3. **The Impower email pattern (reactive displaces planned).** Carried forward 5 times, completed on a Saturday. Fix identified in weekly reflection: protected deep work time for non-meeting deliverables. Fix not yet implemented. Needs a concrete mechanism for February.

4. **Evening rituals are the weak link.** Morning locked. Evening has gaps — AMWAP and Plan Tomorrow missed multiple times in Week 4. Evening close-down is where the system frays, and where tomorrow's success gets set up.

5. **Client acquisition still zero.** 18 months, no new clients. Marketing outreach spent all of January going from "develop plan" to "agree plan" to "review brief" to "align with Matthew" to "Phase 1 alignment session." Trustmark expansion is organic growth, not new pipeline. The business can't grow beyond Scott without new clients.

6. **Carry-forward culture.** Clothes cupboard: 4 weeks. Productive hours: carried multiple days. AWMM roadmap: carried across multiple weeks. Chronic carries erode trust in own planning. Watch whether small unglamorous tasks keep sliding because they're never the MIT.

7. **Dry January objective reframed.** Ended Burns Night (24th). Narrative softened to "new tradition." Own it cleanly — objective set, objective missed. Friday/Saturday rule is the right replacement. Hold it.

8. **Running log stopped.** Last entry: Jan 6. Still running per daily plans but not tracking. If marathon goal is real, data matters. Don't let tracking fade without a conscious decision.

## Big question for February

Mode has been PLANNING since day one. The marketing outreach specifically: when does the first outbound action happen? Planning to plan is still planning.

Decision test to apply: "Are you doing this, or managing someone else doing this?" — and for marketing, the follow-up: "Is the person doing this actually doing it, or are you both still designing what 'doing it' looks like?"

## Suggested February objective inputs

Based on the above, February objectives should address:

**Work:**
- First outbound marketing action executed (not planned — executed)
- Protected deep work blocks in calendar (minimum 2x/week, mornings)
- AWMM roadmap prioritisation completed (carried all of January)
- Productive overhead costs and staff rates finalised (carried multiple times)

**Health:**
- Hydration: concrete target and tracking method (e.g., 2L minimum, tracked daily with G/Gr scores)
- Mobility: decide — commit or remove from tracker
- Running: resume tracking if marathon goal is active
- Screen time baseline set and targets established (committed for Feb)
- Friday/Saturday alcohol rule — first full month, hold it

**Personal:**
- Evening ritual consistency: target 6/7 days for AMWAP and Plan Tomorrow
- Family digital life conversation (captured in task inbox, not yet scheduled)
- Continue relationship investments: Tom, Sophie, Jo, parents
