# LOG

## Memory (AI Notes)

### 2025-12-29
- System initialized. Scott is building a £1m data analytics business, 6+ years in.
- **Business: Crozier Scott Ltd** (www.crozierscott.com)
  - Positioning: CTO-level leadership + data analytics + AI for mid-sized/scaling organizations
  - Services: Data Foundations Diagnostic, Modern Data Platforms, AI Readiness Booster, Custom Digital Products, CTO-as-a-Service
  - Key clients: Abbott World Marathon Majors (platform/CRM), TrustMark (Snowflake/analytics), Impower (NLP platform)
- Goal: Phase out of delivery over 2 years, focus on growth and leadership.
- Known bugs: Steps in to do work, backfills gaps, absorbs margin hits, clients buy "him"
- Challenge style: Direct and blunt. Push toward managing, not doing.
- Health win: Lost 20kg in 7 months, lifting 3x/week consistently.
- Key tension: Business is built around Scott. Transition requires building systems that can fail safely.
- **First systemisation priority defined:** Project visibility via Monday Dashboard
  - 4 KPIs: Sales, Margin, Utilisation (scheduled), Utilisation (available) — MTD + Last Week
  - Project health view with auto flags + Eddie's manual RAG
  - Team utilisation with alert thresholds
  - Requirements doc created: `monday-dashboard-requirements.md`
  - Eddie to build by 19th January in Productive or Excel
- Good sign: Scott delegated the build immediately. Defined requirements, didn't reach for the keyboard.

### 2026-02-04
- **MIT done. Marketing session with Emma — LinkedIn exports reviewed, top 20 shortlist built.** Three of five subtasks complete. Outreach message refinement and send plan carry to Thursday. Impower proposal run-through done. All personal and health tasks done. Gym with Lou, 2L water hit (day 3). Sophie to piano, visited Mum & Dad.
- **OYTS (controlled exposure to fear):** Went deeper than expected — surfaced storytelling and unstructured social performance as the real fear, not professional public speaking (which is improving). Can perform when anchored by expertise, but struggles in social contexts without that anchor. Miami AWMM pitch story illustrates: panic before, brilliance during, lasting relationship after. Weight loss has reduced the physical anxiety. Alcohol is the crutch that makes socialising easier but costs the next day. No specific controlled step identified yet — knows the territory but not the action.
- **AMWAP (health wins):** VO2 max improved to above average for age. Weight down another 2kg since Christmas. Strength training continuing. Family environment calmer — daily practices producing equanimity that others respond to. Delegation working: stayed out of the numbers for a month, team still produced 54K. Meditation making him more contemplative. Monthly family walks happening for the first time in 3 years of saying he would.
- **Mobility:** Simon from Natural Edge sent proper stretching routine. Day 1 was improvised — now has a real programme. Starts tomorrow.

### 2026-02-03
- **8/8 work tasks done. MIT done (weekly work structure).** Full morning rituals day 2 including mobility. Evening rituals complete (Freedom Gap PM, AMWAP, Plan Tomorrow). Second consecutive strong day.
- **Weekly work structure designed and committed to VANGUARD.md.** Deep work days (Mon/Wed/Fri — no stand-up, gym at midday, MIT mornings). People days (Tue/Thu — stand-up, meetings, coaching, business development). Tuesday PM protected for business development. Thursday PM alternates AWMM and team 1:1s (fortnightly). Monday 2pm weekly commercial performance with Emma & Eddie. Monthly overlay mapped: payment run, invoicing, P&L review, commercial review all sequenced around month end. Monthly personal review split: last Friday = look back, first Sunday = planning.
- **AMWAP moved to morning ritual** — stacking where consistency is strongest. Evening rituals simplified.
- **OYTS (relief behaviours):** Three patterns named — alcohol, checking out/avoidance, preemptive resentment/catastrophising. Currently in serving state but knows the triggers. *"I sound convincing even when I'm wrong"* — sharp self-awareness about how articulate deflection masks fear-driven thinking.
- **Badminton energy crash.** Felt shaky and low energy during play. Only 1L water (target 2L), nutrition O. Mounjaro suppressing appetite means he's not eating enough to fuel evening exercise. Tuesday nutrition needs deliberate planning — this is the hydration cascade showing up in real time.
- **Screen time strong:** 3h 32m / 43 pickups — well below baseline (5h 4m / 83). Two days running.
- **AMWAP (habits sticking):** Morning rituals, gym 3x, badminton, moderate eating. Gaps named clearly: stretching, water, running. *Running slipping now Sophie's fallen off — needs to own it independently.* (Same pattern flagged in January review.)

### 2026-02-02
- **Clean sweep day.** MIT done (Pallab email), all 4 work tasks done, all personal tasks done, gym done. Full morning rituals including mobility day 1 and hydration day 1.
- **Marketing session with Emma:** Proposition breakthrough — fractional data leadership + team for mid-sized CEOs. Stopped trying to perfect the message and started mining LinkedIn connections instead. Exports requested, top 20 shortlist by Wed, outreach message refinement Wed.
- **OYTS (fear):** Client acquisition fear surfaced — *"I'm out of my comfort zone... I have not done this kind of thing before."* But response is healthy: naming it, acting on it, committing to persistence. *"I'm not gonna let it cause me to spiral."*
- **AMWAP:** Strong wins. Notable: weight loss now **23kg** (was 20kg). Meditation producing real equanimity benefits. Delegation improving — working WITH Emma, not FOR her.
- **Productive setup done** on Scott's side — Eddie to do final setup with costs.
- **TCS weekly objective added:** Reach agreement with Pallab on data environment access this week.
- **Matthew insight (from Friday meeting):** Trustmark revenue drop is forcing the "living hand to mouth" problem into the open. Business model has been: accept what comes, deliver brilliantly, absorb margin, feel grateful. That's craftsman mode, not business-owner mode. The fix isn't replacing lost Trustmark days — it's building a commercial engine that wins work at proper margins and doesn't flinch when one retainer dips. Connects directly to Bugs #2 and #5. Marketing can't stay in planning mode any longer.
- **LinkedIn action taken today.** Network export requested, database build underway. First real outbound action on marketing — exited planning mode.

### 2026-02-01
- **Monthly planning complete.** January review done, annual objectives set, February objectives set, Week 1 planned, Monday tasks ready.
- **Annual objectives locked in:** Personal (work-life boundaries, documented year), Physical (12st 7lb, off GLP-1, marathon-ready by Dec), Business (out of delivery, 2 new clients, 60% margins, systematisation strong).
- **OYTS:** Hydration is the one habit to nail this week. Bulk before 6pm. Outdoor time also flagged as sleep lever.
- **Calendar overhaul:** Abersoch moved to July, lads weekend cancelled (Tom A-levels), Golf Open 19 Jul added (clashes with 3 Peaks — needs rescheduling), Mark & Oscar visiting March, UTD vs Villa 14 Mar, multiple June additions.
- **Fear theme** for OYTS this week. Interesting choice given the client acquisition challenge.
- **Meditation note:** *"Put a smile in your mind, if only for a moment"* — felt it physically as warmth behind the eyes.
- **Evening:** Bed at 8:15pm — body crashed after a heavy planning day. Woke 1:15am for 2.5 hours (AWMM/TCS on his mind), back to sleep until 7am. AMWAP cancelled. Sleep pattern worth watching — early bed + middle-of-night waking is a recurring signal when work is weighing.

### 2026-01-31
- **January close-out.** Last day of the month. Impower email finally sent (5th carry — clean sweep). Gig with Tom (Stone Roses / Courteeners tribute). Dinner with Jo and the kids.
- **OYTS: pattern analysis response.** Deep engagement with the AI's January pattern analysis. Confirmed the assessment, owned Dry January miss cleanly ("that was an excuse"), committed to mobility and hydration as February additions. Acknowledged carry-forward culture and need to exit planning mode on client acquisition.
- **Running independence needed.** Sophie gone off the boil — Scott eased off too. Needs to own running as his goal, not dependent on Sophie's motivation. Manchester Marathon 2027 with Emma emerging as real possibility.
- **Digital life reflections.** Extended "phone as tool not companion" thinking to AI. Substantial journal entry on screens, children, attention, and the amplifying effect of AI on these problems.
- **First screen time data:** 5h 4m / 83 pickups. Baseline for February targets.
- **New tasks captured:** Ask Dad re socket/heater. Confirm Tom for badminton Tue. Christmas skiing holiday discussed with Jo.

### 2026-01-28
- **MIT done.** Marketing outreach brief reviewed with Emma. Founder-led positioning agreed — "Scott earns belief, Crozier Scott earns confidence, the team earns reliance." Next: Phase 1 alignment session with Emma, show brief to Matthew for input.
- **Trustmark expanded.** Feb retainer going from 5 to 11-12 days. Geography Dimension build + audit data design. Phil showed up — cynicism was unfounded.
- **Pattern noted:** Tendency to jump to execution hurdles (content, process) before finishing the thinking that produces them. Redirected to Phase 1 alignment work.
- **AMWAP evidence:** System working — regularly delegating, monthly billings low, time on business not in it, 85kg (5kg to goal), first monthly walk done, working fewer hours.
- **Carry forwards:** Impower email to Paul Henry, AWMM roadmap prioritisation.

### 2026-01-27
- **MIT done.** Impower estimate deliverable completed and sent to Paul Henry. 49 deliverables across Tier 1 (Configuration Reliability), Tier 2 (Platform Maturity), standalone LG Reorganisation section. Investment options A-D totalling 77-131 days excluding self-service.
- **Full ritual day.** All morning and evening rituals complete including OYTS and AMWAP.
- **OYTS insight:** Two magnetic goals now active — health/healthspan (established) and business growth through teamwork (emerging). The second one is framed correctly: *'Growth through teamwork, growth through sharing success, working to win, earn the trust, win clients and earn their trust.'* Not growth through more Scott hours.
- **AMWAP observation:** Struggled with the prompt (adjusting plans to reflect reality). Conceptually understands it but couldn't surface specific examples. Not a concern — this is a natural thinker, not a rigid planner. The skill is already there; the articulation will come.
- **Carry forwards:** Productive hours logging, cost rate updates — two days running now.

### 2026-01-25
- **Week 3 complete.** Weekend of rest and family time. No work — *'That's part of my objective is to not work at weekends and to be present with my family.'*
- **OYTS insight:** Business growth needs two-step visualisation — (1) grow to ~2.5M turnover, (2) sell and retire. Rejected the "business is in my head" framing: *'I picked that up from Eddie... it's not right.'* Hired Becky specifically to take himself out of the numbers.
- **Wins:** Cinema with Jo and kids (Avatar IMAX), Burns Supper with family (hosted, everyone had a great time), morning rituals both days.
- Week 4 planned. TCS meeting Friday, Theatre Thursday fixed. MIT Monday: Impower estimates.

### 2026-01-22
- **Bounce-back day.** Full morning routine, MIT done (Impower roadmap finally sent), 6 work tasks completed.
- **Delegation win:** 3 problems from yesterday's support disaster — delegated all three, everyone got there in the end. Avoided the frustration of fixing it himself.
- **Becky insight:** "She's a keeper." Responded well to leadership framing (unpaid foundational work, move at pace safely), then delivered fast. Worth investing in.
- **Run PB with Sophie:** 6 min/km pace, beat previous 2-mile time by 20 seconds. Despite 3 stops. VO2 max continuing to improve.
- **Key learning (AMWAP):** Getting back on the horse after bad days is a skill. Simon at Natural Edge: avoid boom/bust and all-or-nothing mentalities. Strong and serving mindset coming through.

### 2026-01-21
- **Write-off day.** Emergency support issue + tiredness from late night (went to bed late). Impower MIT now deferred 3x. Everything carries to Thursday.

### 2026-01-20
- **Solid day.** 5/7 work tasks, full rituals. Impower MIT deferred again — now twice. Tomorrow is heavy (7 work items). Block morning time.
- **AMWAP insight:** Strong wins list — Natural Edge working, VO2 max improving, weight at 12-year low, sales/marketing moving, commercial visibility improving. The system is working.
- **OYTS action:** Client meeting prep process added to workstream backlog. Root cause is absence of process, not capacity.

### 2026-01-19
- **Clean sweep day.** 6/6 tasks, all morning rituals, all evening rituals. Week 3 off to strong start.
- **OYTS insight:** Public speaking named as the performance to make automatic. AMWAP surfaced evidence it's already happened — Miami board meeting (60 people), school leaving speech (off the cuff). The capability exists; the consistency doesn't yet.
- **TCS/AWMM sponsorship confirmed.** TCS entering sponsorship with AWMM including data/tech component. Scott's Data Activation Strategy (proposed 2 years ago) now being implemented — but TCS providing skills, CS providing platform, CS earning project fee from TCS funds.
- **Positioning:** Pragmatic — "better to be involved and shaping than marginalised." Danny and Dawna have reassured trust and important role. Meeting with Danny & Dawna scheduled Friday to align on role and requirements.
- **Risk to watch:** Don't get squeezed on rate because "TCS is free." Don't absorb margin when TCS under-delivers (Bug #2).
- **Opportunity:** Attach name to groundbreaking work, maintain trusted advisor position, potential TCS relationship.

### 2026-01-14
- **Lead qualification lesson (Park Run):** Spent time on a contact that was never a real lead. Signals were clear in hindsight: social introduction (not business need), contact 3 months into role (no authority), no budget (discretionary committed elsewhere), "keep in touch" language throughout.
- **Qualification filter to apply going forward:**
  1. Is there a specific problem they're trying to solve NOW?
  2. Do they have budget or authority to spend?
  3. Did they come to us, or are we chasing?
- If 0/3 or 1/3: it's networking, not sales. Treat accordingly - light touch, don't invest prep time.

### 2026-01-12
- First Monday of Week 2. MIT done (Park Run prep). CWI started. Morning rituals all complete.
- Solid work day: budget refined with Leanne, Eddie's Productive test project discussed, Race Ready meeting done.
- Front room refresh budget agreed at £3,750.
- Clarified workflow: weekly objectives stored in PLAN-2026.md (noted in CLAUDE.md).
- Pattern: Clothes cupboard clearout keeps carrying forward — minor but worth watching.

### 2025-12-30
- **Natural Edge integration complete.** Reviewed Project Eagle vision and 70+ journal entries from original Vanguard program (Feb 2024).
- Created `VANGUARD.md` for daily ritual tracking: morning rituals (breathwork, freedom gap, cold water, mobility, OYTS), daily scores (sleep, steps, nutrition, hydration, outdoors, exercise), evening rituals (freedom gap, AMWAP, plan tomorrow).
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` with LIFE section: Project Eagle vision, EAGLE inspiration statement, physical health commitments, Natural Edge principles, IA Drill.
- Added personal decision tests alongside work decision tests.
- Structure: Scott provides OYTS and AMWAP questions each Sunday. Start-day checks morning rituals and confirms 5 tasks + MIT. End-day runs AMWAP, logs scores, plans tomorrow.
- Key insight from journals: Vision hasn't changed in 2 years. Physical wins prove the system works. Gap is daily ritual consistency, not knowledge or direction.
