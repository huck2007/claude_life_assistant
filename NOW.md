# LOG

## Memory (AI Notes)

### 2025-12-29
- System initialized. Scott is building a £1m data analytics business, 6+ years in.
- **Business: Crozier Scott Ltd** (www.crozierscott.com)
  - Positioning: CTO-level leadership + data analytics + AI for mid-sized/scaling organizations
  - Services: Data Foundations Diagnostic, Modern Data Platforms, AI Readiness Booster, Custom Digital Products, CTO-as-a-Service
  - Key clients: Abbott World Marathon Majors (platform/CRM), TrustMark (Snowflake/analytics), Impower (NLP platform)
- Goal: Phase out of delivery over 2 years, focus on growth and leadership.
- Known bugs: Steps in to do work, backfills gaps, absorbs margin hits, clients buy "him"
- Challenge style: Direct and blunt. Push toward managing, not doing.
- Health win: Lost 20kg in 7 months, lifting 3x/week consistently.
- Key tension: Business is built around Scott. Transition requires building systems that can fail safely.
- **First systemisation priority defined:** Project visibility via Monday Dashboard
  - 4 KPIs: Sales, Margin, Utilisation (scheduled), Utilisation (available) — MTD + Last Week
  - Project health view with auto flags + Eddie's manual RAG
  - Team utilisation with alert thresholds
  - Requirements doc created: `monday-dashboard-requirements.md`
  - Eddie to build by 19th January in Productive or Excel
- Good sign: Scott delegated the build immediately. Defined requirements, didn't reach for the keyboard.

### 2026-02-01
- **Monthly planning complete.** January review done, annual objectives set, February objectives set, Week 1 planned, Monday tasks ready.
- **Annual objectives locked in:** Personal (work-life boundaries, documented year), Physical (12st 7lb, off GLP-1, marathon-ready by Dec), Business (out of delivery, 2 new clients, 60% margins, systematisation strong).
- **OYTS:** Hydration is the one habit to nail this week. Bulk before 6pm. Outdoor time also flagged as sleep lever.
- **Calendar overhaul:** Abersoch moved to July, lads weekend cancelled (Tom A-levels), Golf Open 19 Jul added (clashes with 3 Peaks — needs rescheduling), Mark & Oscar visiting March, UTD vs Villa 14 Mar, multiple June additions.
- **Fear theme** for OYTS this week. Interesting choice given the client acquisition challenge.
- **Meditation note:** *"Put a smile in your mind, if only for a moment"* — felt it physically as warmth behind the eyes.

### 2026-01-31
- **January close-out.** Last day of the month. Impower email finally sent (5th carry — clean sweep). Gig with Tom (Stone Roses / Courteeners tribute). Dinner with Jo and the kids.
- **OYTS: pattern analysis response.** Deep engagement with the AI's January pattern analysis. Confirmed the assessment, owned Dry January miss cleanly ("that was an excuse"), committed to mobility and hydration as February additions. Acknowledged carry-forward culture and need to exit planning mode on client acquisition.
- **Running independence needed.** Sophie gone off the boil — Scott eased off too. Needs to own running as his goal, not dependent on Sophie's motivation. Manchester Marathon 2027 with Emma emerging as real possibility.
- **Digital life reflections.** Extended "phone as tool not companion" thinking to AI. Substantial journal entry on screens, children, attention, and the amplifying effect of AI on these problems.
- **First screen time data:** 5h 4m / 83 pickups. Baseline for February targets.
- **New tasks captured:** Ask Dad re socket/heater. Confirm Tom for badminton Tue. Christmas skiing holiday discussed with Jo.

### 2026-01-28
- **MIT done.** Marketing outreach brief reviewed with Emma. Founder-led positioning agreed — "Scott earns belief, Crozier Scott earns confidence, the team earns reliance." Next: Phase 1 alignment session with Emma, show brief to Matthew for input.
- **Trustmark expanded.** Feb retainer going from 5 to 11-12 days. Geography Dimension build + audit data design. Phil showed up — cynicism was unfounded.
- **Pattern noted:** Tendency to jump to execution hurdles (content, process) before finishing the thinking that produces them. Redirected to Phase 1 alignment work.
- **AMWAP evidence:** System working — regularly delegating, monthly billings low, time on business not in it, 85kg (5kg to goal), first monthly walk done, working fewer hours.
- **Carry forwards:** Impower email to Paul Henry, AWMM roadmap prioritisation.

### 2026-01-27
- **MIT done.** Impower estimate deliverable completed and sent to Paul Henry. 49 deliverables across Tier 1 (Configuration Reliability), Tier 2 (Platform Maturity), standalone LG Reorganisation section. Investment options A-D totalling 77-131 days excluding self-service.
- **Full ritual day.** All morning and evening rituals complete including OYTS and AMWAP.
- **OYTS insight:** Two magnetic goals now active — health/healthspan (established) and business growth through teamwork (emerging). The second one is framed correctly: *'Growth through teamwork, growth through sharing success, working to win, earn the trust, win clients and earn their trust.'* Not growth through more Scott hours.
- **AMWAP observation:** Struggled with the prompt (adjusting plans to reflect reality). Conceptually understands it but couldn't surface specific examples. Not a concern — this is a natural thinker, not a rigid planner. The skill is already there; the articulation will come.
- **Carry forwards:** Productive hours logging, cost rate updates — two days running now.

### 2026-01-25
- **Week 3 complete.** Weekend of rest and family time. No work — *'That's part of my objective is to not work at weekends and to be present with my family.'*
- **OYTS insight:** Business growth needs two-step visualisation — (1) grow to ~2.5M turnover, (2) sell and retire. Rejected the "business is in my head" framing: *'I picked that up from Eddie... it's not right.'* Hired Becky specifically to take himself out of the numbers.
- **Wins:** Cinema with Jo and kids (Avatar IMAX), Burns Supper with family (hosted, everyone had a great time), morning rituals both days.
- Week 4 planned. TCS meeting Friday, Theatre Thursday fixed. MIT Monday: Impower estimates.

### 2026-01-22
- **Bounce-back day.** Full morning routine, MIT done (Impower roadmap finally sent), 6 work tasks completed.
- **Delegation win:** 3 problems from yesterday's support disaster — delegated all three, everyone got there in the end. Avoided the frustration of fixing it himself.
- **Becky insight:** "She's a keeper." Responded well to leadership framing (unpaid foundational work, move at pace safely), then delivered fast. Worth investing in.
- **Run PB with Sophie:** 6 min/km pace, beat previous 2-mile time by 20 seconds. Despite 3 stops. VO2 max continuing to improve.
- **Key learning (AMWAP):** Getting back on the horse after bad days is a skill. Simon at Natural Edge: avoid boom/bust and all-or-nothing mentalities. Strong and serving mindset coming through.

### 2026-01-21
- **Write-off day.** Emergency support issue + tiredness from late night (went to bed late). Impower MIT now deferred 3x. Everything carries to Thursday.

### 2026-01-20
- **Solid day.** 5/7 work tasks, full rituals. Impower MIT deferred again — now twice. Tomorrow is heavy (7 work items). Block morning time.
- **AMWAP insight:** Strong wins list — Natural Edge working, VO2 max improving, weight at 12-year low, sales/marketing moving, commercial visibility improving. The system is working.
- **OYTS action:** Client meeting prep process added to workstream backlog. Root cause is absence of process, not capacity.

### 2026-01-19
- **Clean sweep day.** 6/6 tasks, all morning rituals, all evening rituals. Week 3 off to strong start.
- **OYTS insight:** Public speaking named as the performance to make automatic. AMWAP surfaced evidence it's already happened — Miami board meeting (60 people), school leaving speech (off the cuff). The capability exists; the consistency doesn't yet.
- **TCS/AWMM sponsorship confirmed.** TCS entering sponsorship with AWMM including data/tech component. Scott's Data Activation Strategy (proposed 2 years ago) now being implemented — but TCS providing skills, CS providing platform, CS earning project fee from TCS funds.
- **Positioning:** Pragmatic — "better to be involved and shaping than marginalised." Danny and Dawna have reassured trust and important role. Meeting with Danny & Dawna scheduled Friday to align on role and requirements.
- **Risk to watch:** Don't get squeezed on rate because "TCS is free." Don't absorb margin when TCS under-delivers (Bug #2).
- **Opportunity:** Attach name to groundbreaking work, maintain trusted advisor position, potential TCS relationship.

### 2026-01-14
- **Lead qualification lesson (Park Run):** Spent time on a contact that was never a real lead. Signals were clear in hindsight: social introduction (not business need), contact 3 months into role (no authority), no budget (discretionary committed elsewhere), "keep in touch" language throughout.
- **Qualification filter to apply going forward:**
  1. Is there a specific problem they're trying to solve NOW?
  2. Do they have budget or authority to spend?
  3. Did they come to us, or are we chasing?
- If 0/3 or 1/3: it's networking, not sales. Treat accordingly - light touch, don't invest prep time.

### 2026-01-12
- First Monday of Week 2. MIT done (Park Run prep). CWI started. Morning rituals all complete.
- Solid work day: budget refined with Leanne, Eddie's Productive test project discussed, Race Ready meeting done.
- Front room refresh budget agreed at £3,750.
- Clarified workflow: weekly objectives stored in PLAN-2026.md (noted in CLAUDE.md).
- Pattern: Clothes cupboard clearout keeps carrying forward — minor but worth watching.

### 2025-12-30
- **Natural Edge integration complete.** Reviewed Project Eagle vision and 70+ journal entries from original Vanguard program (Feb 2024).
- Created `VANGUARD.md` for daily ritual tracking: morning rituals (breathwork, freedom gap, cold water, mobility, OYTS), daily scores (sleep, steps, nutrition, hydration, outdoors, exercise), evening rituals (freedom gap, AMWAP, plan tomorrow).
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` with LIFE section: Project Eagle vision, EAGLE inspiration statement, physical health commitments, Natural Edge principles, IA Drill.
- Added personal decision tests alongside work decision tests.
- Structure: Scott provides OYTS and AMWAP questions each Sunday. Start-day checks morning rituals and confirms 5 tasks + MIT. End-day runs AMWAP, logs scores, plans tomorrow.
- Key insight from journals: Vision hasn't changed in 2 years. Physical wins prove the system works. Gap is daily ritual consistency, not knowledge or direction.
