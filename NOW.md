# LOG

## Memory (AI Notes)

### 2025-12-29
- System initialized. Scott is building a £1m data analytics business, 6+ years in.
- Goal: Phase out of delivery over 2 years, focus on growth and leadership.
- Known bugs: Steps in to do work, backfills gaps, absorbs margin hits, clients buy "him"
- Challenge style: Direct and blunt. Push toward managing, not doing.
- Health win: Lost 20kg in 7 months, lifting 3x/week consistently.
- Key tension: Business is built around Scott. Transition requires building systems that can fail safely.
- **First systemisation priority defined:** Project visibility via Monday Dashboard
  - 4 KPIs: Sales, Margin, Utilisation (scheduled), Utilisation (available) — MTD + Last Week
  - Project health view with auto flags + Eddie's manual RAG
  - Team utilisation with alert thresholds
  - Requirements doc created: `monday-dashboard-requirements.md`
  - Eddie to build by 19th January in Productive or Excel
- Good sign: Scott delegated the build immediately. Defined requirements, didn't reach for the keyboard.

### 2026-01-12
- First Monday of Week 2. MIT done (Park Run prep). CWI started. Morning rituals all complete.
- Solid work day: budget refined with Leanne, Eddie's Productive test project discussed, Race Ready meeting done.
- Front room refresh budget agreed at £3,750.
- Clarified workflow: weekly objectives stored in PLAN-2026.md (noted in CLAUDE.md).
- Pattern: Clothes cupboard clearout keeps carrying forward — minor but worth watching.

### 2025-12-30
- **Natural Edge integration complete.** Reviewed Project Eagle vision and 70+ journal entries from original Vanguard program (Feb 2024).
- Created `VANGUARD.md` for daily ritual tracking: morning rituals (breathwork, freedom gap, cold water, mobility, OYTS), daily scores (sleep, steps, nutrition, hydration, outdoors, exercise), evening rituals (freedom gap, AMWAP, plan tomorrow).
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` with LIFE section: Project Eagle vision, EAGLE inspiration statement, physical health commitments, Natural Edge principles, IA Drill.
- Added personal decision tests alongside work decision tests.
- Structure: Scott provides OYTS and AMWAP questions each Sunday. Start-day checks morning rituals and confirms 5 tasks + MIT. End-day runs AMWAP, logs scores, plans tomorrow.
- Key insight from journals: Vision hasn't changed in 2 years. Physical wins prove the system works. Gap is daily ritual consistency, not knowledge or direction.
