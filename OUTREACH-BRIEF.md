# Outreach Campaign Brief

**Date:** 30 Jan 2026 (v2 — refined with Emma's input)
**Owner:** Emma (design & execution)
**Sponsor:** Scott (credibility, selective involvement)
**Status:** Refined working version — for review with Matthew Todd (30 Jan)

---

## Outcome

**By end of 2026:**
- 2 new clients onboarded, averaging £100k+ revenue each
- 5-10 qualified leads / opportunities in active pipeline

**Why now:**
- Trustmark revenue uncertain (likely to stabilise at a lower level)
- Business needs 4-5 active clients to sustain the current team
- Outreach is the foundation for a repeatable pipeline engine, supporting Scott stepping back from day-to-day delivery over time

---

## Anchor Statement

> Scott is the reason people say yes to the first conversation.
> Crozier Scott is the reason they feel safe saying yes to the work.

---

## Founder-Led Positioning

The outreach approach is founder-led. If Scott isn't at or near the front of the comms, the messaging sounds generic and the value feels replaceable. The "why us?" question becomes harder to answer.

**The trust sequence:**

1. **Scott earns belief** — outbound is the trust creation phase. Prospects care about: "Will this person understand my mess? Have they seen this before? Will I look stupid if I trust them?" Those questions are answered by Scott.
2. **Crozier Scott earns confidence** — once trust exists, the company becomes reassuring: continuity, depth, resilience, delivery capacity.
3. **The team earns reliance** — through consistent, senior-level execution.

If you reverse that order, outbound weakens.

**On the "too small" concern:** Scott is the reason people say yes to the first conversation. At the outreach stage, carefully targeted prospects care less about team size and more about credibility, relevance, and whether they'll be understood.

## Target Profile

**Who we want:**
- Sub-£50m turnover (sweet spot: sub-£20m)
- No in-house data / technology leadership
- CEO / MD access available
- Increasing organisational complexity (growth, regulation, ambition)
- Data exists but leadership visibility is limited
- Foundations not designed for current or future demands (AI, automation)
- Healthy margins and appetite to invest

**Who we avoid:**
- Retail / e-commerce
- Low-margin or volume-driven businesses
- Organisations seeking analytics support only

---

## Sectors to Explore

**Priority:**
- Sport / membership organisations
- Charity / not-for-profit
- Asset-heavy or compliance-adjacent organisations *[for discussion with Matthew]*

---

## Where to Fish

**Primary:**
- Scott's LinkedIn network
- Targeted LinkedIn research

**Secondary:**
- Warm introductions
- Referral partners (fractional CTOs, consultants)
- Small senior events (roundtables, breakfasts)

---

## Value Proposition

**Core framing** *[for discussion]*:

> Leadership-level clarity on data, systems, and risk — at the point where growth, regulation, or AI exposes weak foundations.

Scott's original message: *"Analytics underpinned by quality data — never more important than in the age of AI opportunity and threat."*

Emma's proposed positioning adds the founder-led layer on top. Both framings are complementary — the first is the what, the second is the why-us.

**What we do:**
- CTO-level diagnosis and strategic technology leadership
- Data, analytics, and AI readiness strategy
- Digital opportunity and risk assessment
- Full-service delivery (£50k-£200k builds, ~£5k/month ongoing)

**Scott's role:** Early-stage judgement and clarity
**Crozier Scott's role:** Senior delivery team and sustained execution

---

## Outreach Principles

- Outbound earns conversations, not sales
- Emma is the front door
- Scott is deployed selectively
- Early disqualification is success

---

## Outreach Structure

### Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): Foundation

- Narrative and core offering alignment (Scott + Emma)
- Prospect longlist
- Warm activation (Matthew, Nimble, LinkedIn network)
- Research and shortlist spring events to attend
- Pipeline setup / tracking
- Scott and Emma sharpen LinkedIn profiles
- Sharpen Crozier Scott company profile

### Phase 2 (Weeks 3-6): Outreach

- Targeted messages per week (cadence TBD — Emma to propose realistic number)
- Emma-led conversations
- Selective Scott involvement
- Sector focus
- Introduce diagnostic / review offering *[needs definition — what does the client get? Strong lead magnet if defined properly]*
- Shape 1-2 real opportunities
- Website case studies on core areas *[for discussion: which WMM area to lead with? Trustmark timing given current situation?]*

## Outreach Messaging

**Cold version (generic):**

> Hi [Name] — hope you don't mind the message.
>
> I'm Emma at Crozier Scott. I'm reaching out because growth, regulation, or AI ambitions often start to put real pressure on data and decision foundations that were never designed for this level of complexity.
>
> We work with leadership teams who don't have in-house tech or data leadership and want a clear, honest view on where the real risks and opportunities sit — before those pressures become expensive or distracting.
>
> Scott leads our CTO advisory and stays close to early diagnosis, with a senior delivery team behind him to execute where it makes sense.
>
> If it would be useful, I'd be happy to offer a brief conversation to explore whether this is relevant. If not, no need to respond.
>
> Best,
> Emma

## Open Questions for Discussion

1. **Core framing** — Scott's "analytics + quality data in the age of AI" vs Emma's "leadership-level clarity on data, systems, and risk." Complementary? Pick one for outbound? Use both in different contexts?
2. **Diagnostic / review offering** — What is it? What does the client get? How is it positioned (free, paid, time-limited)? This could be a strong lead magnet if properly defined.
3. **Case studies** — Which WMM project to lead with? Is Trustmark the right one given current uncertainty? Timing matters.
4. **Sectors** — Asset-heavy / compliance-adjacent: what does this look like in practice? Examples? Matthew's view?
5. **Outreach cadence** — Emma to propose a realistic number per week. Quality over volume.
6. **Parkrun** — Formally close or keep as background networking?

## Not in Scope (Yet)

- Resourcing plan for delivery (data science, AI automation, customer-facing PMs)
- Tooling for AI automation capability
- Paid outreach tools (LinkedIn Sales Navigator etc.) — revisit if organic approach gains traction
