# Outreach Campaign Brief for Emma

**Date:** 9 Jan 2026
**Owner:** Emma (execution), Scott (sponsorship)
**Status:** Draft for review

---

## Outcome

**By end of 2026:**
- 2 new clients onboarded, averaging £100k revenue each
- 5-10 qualified leads/opportunities in active pipeline

**Why now:** Trustmark revenue uncertain (likely to stabilise but at lower levels). Need 4-5 active clients to sustain the current team. This also becomes the pipeline engine for when Scott steps back from delivery.

---

## Target Profile

**Who we want:**
- Sub £50m turnover (sweet spot: sub £20m)
- No in-house data/tech capability
- CEO/MD level engagement available (not selling to IT directors or internal data teams)
- Has data (or is about to) that's underexploited — latent commercial opportunity
- Curious revenue model with digital headroom, not low-margin/high-volume

**Sectors to explore:**
- Sports (if Parkrun + Bicycle Association land, this becomes a credible vertical)
- Charity / not-for-profit
- Avoid: Retail / e-commerce (race to the bottom, margin pressure = our revenue at risk)

**Where to fish:**
- Scott's LinkedIn network (previous colleagues, business associates)
- New prospects in target sectors via LinkedIn research
- Referral partners: fractional CTOs, consultants in adjacent spaces

---

## Value Proposition

**Core message:**
> "Analytics underpinned by quality data — never more important than in the age of AI opportunity and threat."

**What we do:**
- Data analytics strategy for organisations without in-house capability
- AI readiness and automation strategy
- Digital opportunity assessment at leadership level
- Full-service delivery: platform build (£50-200k), ongoing maintenance (~£5k/month), roadmap evolution

**What makes us stick:**
- We don't build and leave — we stay, iterate, and grow with you
- Scott's experience and credibility positions us as a safe pair of hands at exec level
- Strong technical delivery (Snowflake, AWS) with modern, pragmatic approach

---

## Resources & Constraints

- **Budget:** Scrappy outreach only — no paid tools or ads for now
- **Starting point:** More or less from scratch + LinkedIn connections
- **Emma's assets:** She brought Bicycle Association and Parkrun to the table — she knows how to find and qualify prospects

---

## Warm Connections to Activate

| Contact | Context | Action |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Matthew Todd | Retired, offered to spread the word when we have a message | **Scott activates first**, then hands to Emma |
| Nimble CEO | Previous collaboration, Scott owes a call | **Scott activates first**, then hands to Emma |
| LinkedIn network | Previous colleagues and associates | Emma to review and identify warm outreach targets |

---

## Current Pipeline (Context)

| Client | Status |
|--------|--------|
| World Marathon Majors | Active |
| Impower | Semi-active |
| Trustmark | Keep-the-lights-on (likely to recover in a few months) |
| Bicycle Association | Early prospect |
| Parkrun | Early prospect |

---

## What Emma Decides

Scott sets intent. Emma owns the how:
- Outreach channels and cadence
- Messaging and positioning for different segments
- Prospect research and qualification criteria
- How she tracks and manages the pipeline

---

## Reporting & Investment

**Cadence:** Weekly pipeline update (async) — leads, blockers, next steps

**Tools:** Scrappy outreach for now. If it works, budget available for LinkedIn Sales Navigator or similar.

---

## Scott's Actions (Before Handover)

1. Reconnect with Matthew Todd — set context, then hand to Emma
2. Call Nimble CEO — explore collaboration, then hand to Emma
3. Brief Emma on this document and align on first week's focus

---

## Not in Scope (Yet)

- Resourcing plan for delivery (data science, AI automation, customer-facing PMs) — separate workstream
- Tooling for AI automation capability — noted for later
