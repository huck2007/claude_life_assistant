# WEEKLY REFLECTION

*Friday focus — go deep, not surface*

1. Have I been diving deep enough or have I been spiritually bypassing and just staying on the surface, avoiding discomfort?
2. Can I identify where the things holding me back are stemming from?
3. Can I see any patterns emerging?

## Week of 5 Jan - 11 Jan 2026

**Q1: Diving deep or bypassing?**
Deep. Living the examined life. CWI and AMWAP deferred intentionally — habit stacking, not failure. First things first.

**Q2: What's holding me back?**
Nothing structural — working systematically: MI first (Eddie owns) → Process (quoting, onboarding, agile) → Governance. Need to shift gear and style for next level. May need additional people, not necessarily different people. Eddie situation to be addressed directly — conversation scheduled for Fri 16 Jan.

**Q3: Patterns emerging?**
1. Business dependency on me — addressed via MI → Process → Governance sequence
2. Stand-up ownership — daily example of backfilling. Needs structured handover (added to Monday 12 Jan)

---

# OYTS SUMMARIES

*For Friday weekly reflection*

## Tuesday 13 Jan
**Question:** What is one outcome you would love to achieve in the next 12 months that would truly change your life? What do you see, hear, feel, smell, and sense when you imagine the moment you achieve that outcome?

**Summary:** Nothing immediately "life-changing" comes to mind. Weight loss nearly complete (2-3 months to target). Real answer emerged: business able to run without me.

**12-month vision:** Reduced to 3 days/week. Help Jo launch her business. More time outdoors — hiking, hills, sweating, inspiring views. "Spending more time in nature is a big deal for me."

**Project Eagle connection:** House in countryside, surrounded by fields instead of roofs and fences. But wary of materialistic objectives.

**Key tension:** 3 days/week is NOT consistent with growing the business. Must be present, but present as leader, not doer. Will only backfill in extreme emergencies — otherwise coach and support others to do the task.

**Conclusion:** Not one life-changing thing. Several levers being pulled: health, personal life, business. The work continues.

---

## Monday 12 Jan
**Question:** What is a goal you have been chasing that currently feels flat or uninspiring—and why might that be?

**Summary:** Most goals are on track (weight, fitness, business starting fresh). The "flat" feeling is about business positioning.

**Core tension:** Positioned as "data analytics consultancy" but that doesn't capture what we really are — a specialist squad that gets shit done under Scott's leadership across multiple technology domains. Data is a means to an end, not the whole offering.

**WMM example:** They didn't hire us for data analytics. They wanted Scott's tech leadership and consulting capability. Data was just part of it.

**What's uninspiring:** The current messaging feels limiting. "Paying homage to one thing troubles me because we can do more than that."

**The work this year:** Learn how to frame what we are through conversations with prospects. Make sure it comes through in marketing, LinkedIn, sales meetings, and existing client relationships. Some existing clients don't understand what we could do for them.

**Connection to bugs:** #5 (clients buy Scott). The value is the leadership and ability to bridge gaps — not a narrow service definition.

---

## Sunday 11 Jan
**Question:** Which decisions did you make this week that technically didn't need to be yours, even if you were capable of making them?

**Summary:** Not many this week (quieter period), but one clear example.

**Eddie example:** Eddie estimated 14 days for a piece of work. On a client call, client asked for more scope and Eddie made it sound trivial. Scott stepped in on the call to flag it needed review, then gave feedback afterwards: go back with a formal quote including contingency, and in future — don't commit to additional scope on the spot. You can always say "leave it with me."

**Why it shouldn't have been Scott's decision:** Eddie knows better by now. The impulse to be "the good guy" and helpful is understandable, but "we're not doing a favour for a mate — we're a commercial entity."

**Connection to bugs:** #2 (takes on ambitious projects, absorbs margin hit). Eddie's instinct to over-promise creates exactly this pattern.

**Note:** Quieter week for examples. This question will be more revealing in full-flow work weeks.

---

## Saturday 10 Jan
**Question:** When you delegate, where do things most often break down, and how much of that comes from unclear mission briefs rather than poor execution?

**Summary:** People-dependent, and a mix of both — but briefing isn't the core issue.

**Innovation/uncertainty work:**
- Scott is comfortable operating in uncertainty (working with concepts, pushing strategic boundaries, bridging tech/business gap). Most staff are not.
- Phil handles freedom well once he has context, but pushing beyond boundaries isn't his default.
- Clients value Scott specifically for this capability — they've had tech opportunities slip away with IT people who couldn't bridge the gap. This is why they buy "Scott."
- When staff push boundaries without close supervision, problems occur. When they don't bring best practice to technical implementation, quality suffers.
- Commercial/time pressures compound the problem — innovation work and tight deadlines don't mix well.

**Scott's protective role:** Shield team from commercial pressure, give space to learn, don't bite off more than can chew, stay close to details on risk factors.

**Admin/operational delegation:**
- Briefing isn't the problem. Experience and expertise are.
- Junior or inexperienced staff (Leanne, Eddie specifically) can't take outcome-based briefs and deliver without leaving holes to plug.
- Creates "might as well have done it myself" sensation.

**Connection to bugs:** #1 (steps in), #3 (backfills expertise gaps), #5 (clients buy Scott). The nature of the work and the experience gap in the team reinforce why Scott stays central.

**Key tension:** The very thing clients pay for (Scott's ability to operate in uncertainty and bridge gaps) is the thing that's hardest to delegate.

---

## Friday 9 Jan
**Question:** What resources, authority, or support do people hesitate to use because they're unsure what's actually available to them?

**Summary:** Not a clarity problem — it's a "me" problem. The main resource people think they need is Scott, and some think he's too busy. But it's person-specific:

**By person:**
- **Emma** — Model. Knows how to use Scott, proactive, independent, loops in appropriately. No issue.
- **Dave** — Similar. Loyal, given latitude during wife's medical situation. Could be more proactive but solid.
- **Phil** — Too independent. Avoidance pattern — doesn't want help, wants his own way. Long relationship, manageable. Message landed on not over-servicing clients.
- **Anthony** — Won't use support from Scott or others, over-relies on Dave. Training resources available but struggles with tests — on pause.
- **Eddie** — Uses Scott TOO MUCH. Lacks confidence, resilience, authority skills. Likely depressed. Stuck in Scott's Northstar, not his own. Paid well so feels trapped. Scott's been harsh on his decisions before — needs to measure feedback better. Good example yesterday: measured, supportive feedback that landed well. But this won't fix the deeper issue.
- **Becky** — Excellent. Resourceful, proactive, uses everything available. Early days, not yet invested with authority.

**Key insight:** The question reframed itself. It's not "what resources are unclear" — it's "what's the relationship each person has with using me as a resource, and what does that reveal?"

**Eddie flag:** This is the clearest signal yet that Eddie's situation needs addressing. Not a performance problem — a life problem. He's stuck.

---

## Wednesday 7 Jan
**Question:** Which part of your identity is most tied to being "the one who knows" or "the one who fixes," and how does that shape the way you lead?

**Summary:** "The one who knows" is core to professional identity — 30 years synthesizing technology fast, pride in quick understanding, leads with opinions to shape the team.

**Tension:** Comfortable as the knowledgeable one, but gets frustrated when pulled into "the one who fixes" role. This happens when managers can't handle difficult techies — has to interpret and firefight instead of direct.

**Impact on leadership:** Fixing and interpreting drains leadership capacity. Backfilling the gap instead of developing the capability in others.

**Connection to bugs:** #1 (steps in), #3 (backfills expertise gaps). The managers who can't navigate technical people are the structural gap.

**Open question:** What would it take for those managers to handle it themselves — even badly at first?

---

## Tuesday 6 Jan
**Question:** How would your business behave tomorrow if you were unavailable for an entire week, and what does that reveal about its fragility or resilience?

**Summary:** Emma would be fine — commercially experienced, independent. Eddie raised concerns — legitimate feelings, but pattern of inverting confidence issues into other people's problems, then refusing to engage with responsibilities. Ready with objections to everything. Need to help him help himself, or at least keep him focused on key tasks.

**Rest of team:** Phil, Dave, Becky would stay busy for a week. Anthony wouldn't.

**Key insight:** What about a MONTH? Business would grind to a halt. Responsibilities, processes, policies, oversight — all concentrated in my hands and head.

**Connection:** This is exactly why the mini-retirement thinking matters. If a month breaks the business, the structure isn't right.

---

## Monday 5 Jan
**Question:** Which decisions currently run through you by default, and how does that affect your ability to think strategically?

**Summary:** Almost all decisions run through me by default. Realistic that team aren't experienced enough yet — but this means time is occupied with tactical, not strategic.

**By person:**
- **Emma** — Trusted on WMM (e-commerce, commercial, relationships). Not tech design.
- **Phil** — Trusted on existing platforms, but not bigger picture or reducing dependency on himself. Sees change as weakening his position. Needs better framing with intent and objectives.
- **Eddie/Trustmark/Impower** — Key dependencies on me that drain time.
- **Dave** — Hasn't taken on responsibility well (personal issues), but those are behind him. Can invest in delegation now.
- **Becky** — Learning. Support her to do the do, not do it for her.

**Key insight:** Christmas break gave perspective and distance. Setting up for a better outcome — but the work is framing responsibilities with intent, not just tasks.

**Connection to bugs:** #1 (steps in), #3 (backfills expertise), #5 (clients buy Scott).

---

## Tuesday 30 Dec
**Question:** How would your business behave tomorrow if you were unavailable for an entire week, and what does that reveal about its fragility or resilience?

**Summary:** Two-speed business. Majors side (Emma, Phil) would run fine — clear roadmap, Emma owns commercial performance, Phil takes ownership even without formal structure. Trustmark/Power side would stall — too dependent on Scott for decisions, unclear workload, team would be stuck.

**Key Insights:**
1. Partial resilience exists where responsibility is clear (Emma on WMM)
2. Phil operates well because of long working relationship, not formal structure — fragile if he left
3. Responsibility gap + expertise gap on Trustmark side = structural problem
4. Fix is clear: job descriptions, responsibility mapping, SOPs
5. Some clients don't warrant ongoing deployment — project-based model may be more honest

**Connection to bugs:** This is Bug #3 (backfills expertise gaps) and Bug #5 (clients buy Scott) in action.
