# THIS WEEK

**Week of:** 9 - 15 Feb 2026 (Week 2 Feb)

## Week Objectives

1. **AWMM roadmap prioritised and quarterly meetings scheduled** — present at Thursday 1:30 meeting
2. **Two meetings scheduled with outreach targets** — chase 12 messages from last week, book conversations
3. **Business strategy direction set** — AI & Data consultancy, or Fractional CTO with team? Decide with Emma. This unlocks all marketing.

## Week Focus

**Work:**
1. AWMM roadmap prioritisation — complete Mon/Tue, present Thursday. Schedule quarterly review cadence with Danny.
2. Outreach follow-up — review responses from 12 messages, chase non-responders, target 2 meetings booked this week
3. Strategy direction conversation with Emma — honest assessment: what are we, what do we sell, what can the team deliver? Use Friday's OYTS insight as the starting point.
4. Monday Dashboard / commercial performance with Emma & Eddie (Mon 2pm)
5. Trustmark project meeting (Wed 10am)
6. AWMM project meeting (Thu 1:30)

**Health:**
1. Hydration: 2L daily, bulk before 6pm
2. Mobility: 15-20 min daily — rebuild after weekend drop
3. Lifting 3x with Lou (Mon, Wed, Fri)
4. Running 2x minimum — Tuesday midday and Saturday AM. No excuses. February target is 2x/week and Week 1 was zero.
5. Alcohol: Fri/Sat only

**Personal:**
1. Evening rituals: reset after 4-day drop. Target 6/7 AMWAP and Plan Tomorrow.
2. Screen time tracking continues — keep below baseline (5h 4m / 83 pickups)
3. Sunday lunch at Jenny & John's (15 Feb) — Jo, Tom & Sophie

## OYTS Questions

*Week 2 theme: Identity & Direction. Builds on Week 1 fear breakthrough — from "what am I afraid of?" to "what am I going to build?"*

| Day | Question |
|-----|----------|
| Mon | What does Crozier Scott actually do better than anyone else? Not what you want it to do — what does it do today? |
| Tue | If you stopped calling yourself a "data analytics business" tomorrow, what would you build instead? |
| Wed | What would your three best clients say you gave them that nobody else could? |
| Thu | What does the team need to become to match the business you want to build — and is that realistic in 12 months? |
| Fri | The strategy direction is set. What's the first thing that changes next week? |
| Sat | What's the version of this business that genuinely excites you — not the safe version, the real one? |
| Sun | If you're honest: are you building a business to sell, or a practice to enjoy? Does the answer change anything? |

## AMWAP Questions

*Week 2 format refresh: single reflective questions instead of "list N wins." Less homework, more depth.*

| Day | Question |
|-----|----------|
| Mon | What's one thing you did recently that the version of you from 12 months ago couldn't have done? |
| Tue | Where in your life right now is the gap between intention and action smallest? |
| Wed | What habit or practice has become so automatic you'd notice its absence more than its presence? |
| Thu | What's one relationship that's stronger now because of how you've shown up recently? |
| Fri | What did you do this week that moved the business forward without you doing the delivery? |
| Sat | What's the clearest evidence that your health transformation is real and lasting? |
| Sun | What are you most proud of from this week — and why that, specifically? |

# WEEKLY REFLECTION

*Friday focus — go deep, not surface*

1. Have I been diving deep enough or have I been spiritually bypassing and just staying on the surface, avoiding discomfort?
2. Can I identify where the things holding me back are stemming from?
3. Can I see any patterns emerging?
4. How was my device behaviour this week? (Screen time, pickups, presence)

## Week of 2 Feb - 8 Feb 2026

**Q1: Diving deep or bypassing?**
Deep enough. OYTS quality was the strongest week yet — a complete thread from naming the fear (Mon) through relief behaviours (Tue), controlled exposure (Wed), doing the reps (Thu), to confronting the biggest avoidance (Fri: marketing). Friday's OYTS was a breakthrough: the marketing avoidance isn't laziness, it's a genuine belief the team can't deliver what a "data analytics business" promises. AMWAP slipping though — finding them "a bit naff." Need to either refresh the format or accept they're not landing and adjust.

**Q2: What's holding me back?**
Usual suspect behaviours and situations — but actively dealing with them. The BA call today is evidence: leaning into the fear, having the conversations, not avoiding. 12 outreach messages sent Thursday. The holding-back is more about sleep and energy now than mindset.

**Q3: Patterns emerging?**
1. **Starting the working day later.** Morning rituals are strong (5/5 most days this week) but the transition from rituals to work is soft. Deep work mornings aren't starting as early as the structure intended.
2. **Sleep disruption cascading.** Sleep scored T twice this week (Sun night, Thu night). Arm numbness waking him up. Bad sleep → late start → compressed day → rituals slip in the evening. The pillow research is a practical fix worth pursuing.
3. **AMWAP losing energy.** Morning AMWAP (moved there from evening in week design) hasn't stuck — missed 3 of 5 days. The "wins" format may need refreshing or the questions aren't resonating. Worth discussing with Natural Edge or changing the prompt style.

**OYTS Synthesis (Week 1 Feb):**
Complete fear thread across the week — the most connected sequence yet:
- **Mon:** Client acquisition fear named — grounded in reality (only 3 clients, no proven method) but response is healthy
- **Tue:** Relief behaviours — alcohol, checking out, catastrophising. Three patterns, all identified
- **Wed:** Controlled exposure — surfaced storytelling/social performance as the deeper personal fear, not professional speaking
- **Thu:** Doing the reps — fear setting technique (Define, Prevent, Repair). Already doing it informally with Emma. 12 messages sent despite the fear.
- **Fri:** What are you still avoiding? — Marketing. The biggest one. Team capability gap is real, not imagined. Honest proposition is Scott as fractional CTO, not "data analytics powerhouse."

**Thread:** The fear work this week produced a genuine insight that reframes the marketing challenge. Stop selling what you're not; sell what you are. The BA call validated this in real time.

---

## Week of 26 Jan - 1 Feb 2026

**Q1: Diving deep or bypassing?**
Deep enough. OYTS journals this week were strongly connected — doubt as root distraction (Wed), honest gap assessment (Thu), hydration chain (Fri), identity votes (Fri). Daily meditation practice consistent. Depth is not the issue.

**Q2: What's holding me back?**
Leadership and delegation — still working on it, progress is real. New insight this week: alcohol is a saboteur, not a reward. Burns Night ended Dry January; one night of drinks produced tiredness and low mood the next day. Evidence that alcohol doesn't serve. Friday/Saturday rule is set — hold it. Also: reactive work from others displaces important-but-not-urgent deliverables. Impower email carried 5 times before being completed on a Saturday. Need a blocking mechanism for non-meeting work — protected morning time before the reactive stuff starts.

**Q3: Patterns emerging?**
1. **Buffeted by others' task management** — unplanned work displaces planned execution, creating carry-forward items. Need protected deep work time.
2. **Multi-day tasks disguised as single items** — the Impower estimate was always multi-day but appeared as one line that kept deferring. Break larger deliverables into daily chunks so progress is visible and carries are meaningful.
3. **Alcohol impact** — clear data point. Low mood, tiredness, reduced command. Not serving.

**Q4: Device behaviour**
3.5 hours average daily screen time — too much passive Chrome browsing. Chrome Discover now off. iOS Focus mode being set up today. This is the baseline to beat in February.

**OYTS Synthesis (Week 4):**
This week's journaling clustered around **identity, doubt, and patterns**:
- **Equanimity and command** (Mon): Future version shows up controlled, consistent, committed, patient. Leading self leads to leading others.
- **Health as magnetic goal, business growth emerging** (Tue): Two magnetic goals now active. Business growth framed correctly — through teamwork, not more Scott hours.
- **Doubt as root distraction** (Wed): Food and alcohol are coping mechanisms during doubt-heavy periods. Daily routines are the defence. "I will tackle doubt by being in command of my life."
- **Honest gap** (Thu): 70/30 split — 70% unavoidable (health transformation, family), 30% is style (doing vs leading). Health was prerequisite, not detour.
- **Identity votes** (Fri): Almost everything this week voted for the identity being built. Only saboteur: hydration (and its downstream impact on sleep and rituals).

**Thread:** The system is working. The gaps are specific and fixable — hydration, alcohol rules, protected work time, breaking multi-day tasks down. No systemic failure. Course corrections, not overhauls.

**New this week:** Digital Life commitment added to CLAUDE.md. Screen time and pickups tracking begins February. Family conversation on device principles scheduled.

## Week of 19 Jan - 25 Jan 2026

**Q1: Diving deep or bypassing?**
Deep enough. No danger of bypassing — naturally serious and reflective. Wednesday's write-off day tested resilience, but got back on the horse. Perfection isn't necessary; recovery is the skill.

**Q2: What's holding me back?**
Same themes: difficult client situations and staff not yet assuming responsibility at the level needed. Actively improving this — reframing issues as growth opportunities, delegating more, staying out of technical implementation.

**Q3: Patterns emerging?**
Positive patterns: ritual consistency correlates directly with sense of progress. Physical training reinforces mental state. Sleep is variable — afternoon coffee likely the culprit.

**OYTS Synthesis (Week 3):**
This week's journaling clustered around **performance and preparation**:
- **Public speaking and social performance** (Mon + Fri): Avoidance kicks in when overwhelmed. Antidote is positive mental rehearsal — look forward to it, see the good, commit to giving it best shot. Preparation and mindset are the enablers, not natural talent.
- **Client meeting prep** (Tue): Feeling scattered in client meetings. Root cause is absence of process, not capacity. Team needs to own the briefing so Scott stops winging it.
- **TCS/AWMM positioning** (Thu): Pragmatic positioning — better to be involved and shaping than marginalised. Prepared well, meeting went well.

**Thread:** When you prepare properly and get your head right, you perform. When you don't, you wing it and it shows. The system works when you work the system.

## Week of 12 Jan - 18 Jan 2026

**Q1: Diving deep or bypassing?**
Deep enough. Audio OYTS preferred — more organic, allows deeper exploration. Written (Thu-Sat this week) still revealing but more concise than ideal. The practice is working.

**Q2: What's holding me back?**
Team execution on priorities:
- **Emma** — busy, but this week's marketing meeting barriers were avoidable. Must not happen again.
- **Eddie** — inexperienced, needs hand-holding. Pattern of over-complicating. Needs to stick to brief: client scheduled time vs client budget. Not detailed task management with milestone budgets — that's killed us before.

Without driving these, marketing won't happen and operational control won't improve.

**Action:** Add "Log work hours" to daily close down routine.

**Q3: Patterns emerging?**
When I ask for things, other things get in the way. Two flavours:
1. Emma = avoidable interruptions. Fixable with focus.
2. Eddie = structural inexperience. Learning must be shaped — simplicity over complexity, immediate priority over elaborate systems.

Eddie conversation happened (Fri 16 return journey). Now it's about follow-through.

---

## Week of 5 Jan - 11 Jan 2026

**Q1: Diving deep or bypassing?**
Deep. Living the examined life. CWI and AMWAP deferred intentionally — habit stacking, not failure. First things first.

**Q2: What's holding me back?**
Nothing structural — working systematically: MI first (Eddie owns) → Process (quoting, onboarding, agile) → Governance. Need to shift gear and style for next level. May need additional people, not necessarily different people. Eddie situation to be addressed directly — conversation scheduled for Fri 16 Jan.

**Q3: Patterns emerging?**
1. Business dependency on me — addressed via MI → Process → Governance sequence
2. Stand-up ownership — daily example of backfilling. Needs structured handover (added to Monday 12 Jan)

# OYTS SUMMARIES

*For Friday weekly reflection*

## Monday 9 Feb
**Question:** What does Crozier Scott actually do better than anyone else? Not what you want it to do — what does it do today?

**Summary:** Honest capability audit. Not "better than anyone" — but what CS is genuinely good at. The answer is a capabilities list, not a mission statement.

**Key themes:**
- **Platform building and integration** — quickly understanding technology, seeing where it applies, connecting disparate things into a living product
- **Commitment and staying the course** — when things go wrong, CS takes responsibility rather than hiding behind contracts. Ethics, not just capability.
- **Translation** — speaking to clients, understanding their needs, translating that into technology solutions they can understand
- **Problem solving under pressure** — navigating emergencies, prioritising, fixing fast. Particularly strong in blank-sheet and crisis contexts.
- **Specific technical strengths:** Data engineering, Snowflake, AWS, Terraform. Cost-conscious delivery.

**Key insight:** The honest list maps almost entirely to Scott's personal capabilities, not the team's. The one moment of aspiration — "if we were good at data strategy, data science, bringing analytics to life, we'd be a data analytics powerhouse" — was immediately flagged as "not what we do today." This directly feeds the strategy direction conversation at 2pm: the business IS Scott's translation/integration/problem-solving wrapped in a small team, not a data analytics capability.

**Connection:** Builds on Friday's fear breakthrough (marketing feels like lying because the team can't deliver the analytics promise). Today's answer confirms the honest positioning: we're translators, integrators, and problem-solvers who stay the course. The analytics brand doesn't match the actual capability.

---

## Friday 6 Feb
**Question:** What actions or decisions have you been avoiding because of fear?

**Summary:** Marketing the business. The avoidance isn't laziness or planning-mode — it's a genuine fear that the team can't deliver what a "data analytics business" promises. The gap between what he sells and what the team can produce is the core tension.

**Key themes:**
- **Capability gap is real, not imagined.** Anthony's BI work doesn't "dazzle" — not intuitive, not storytelling, not client-ready. Eddie's weaknesses compound this. Becky is strong on data engineering but that's one person.
- **Identity mismatch:** The business has won work as "Scott the fractional CTO who happens to have a data team" — not as a data analytics consultancy. Every client bought Scott's ability to bridge tech/business, not the team's analytics capability.
- **Marketing feels like lying:** Positioning as a data analytics business when the delivery team can't consistently produce work that excites him feels dishonest. *"It puts me in a position where I feel I have to lie."*
- **The comfortable path:** Another CTO-style client who buys Scott directly. He knows this works, but it's absorbing and doesn't scale — which is exactly what he's trying to move away from.
- **AI/agentic caveat:** Acknowledges AI could change the equation on development capability, but wary of "vibe coding our way to something crap."
- **Fear cascade:** Fear of marketing → fear of exposure → fear of committing to deliverables the team can't handle → easier to avoid entirely.

**Key insight:** The marketing avoidance isn't about client acquisition skills — it's about product confidence. He doesn't fully believe in what the team delivers beyond his personal involvement. This is Bug #5 (clients buy Scott) seen from the inside: he knows it's true and doesn't know how to market around it honestly.

**Connection:** Completes the week's fear thread: name the fear (Mon) → notice escape patterns (Tue) → find the controlled step (Wed) → do the reps (Thu) → what are you still avoiding? (Fri). Answer: the biggest one. The one underneath all the others.

---

## Thursday 5 Feb
**Question:** What does "doing the reps" look like for your fears — and what would it take to stay consistent with that process?

**Summary:** Fear setting from Natural Edge is the technique. Three steps: (1) Define — list worst things that could happen, (2) Prevent — what can reduce the chances, (3) Repair — how to recover if worst happens, who could help. Then ask: benefits of action vs cost of inaction. Goal isn't fearlessness — it's stopping fear from dictating behaviour when performance matters.

**Key themes:**
- Already doing this informally with Emma on marketing fears — reasoning through positioning challenges without labelling it fear setting
- Low-level fear around marketing: stuck between founder-led approach (which won't attract) and proposition-led (which exposes capability gaps)
- Taking action despite the fear — 12 messages out today
- "Doing the reps" = monthly check-in with fears as part of reflection, then use fear setting technique where needed

**Key insight:** The fear doesn't disappear, but you keep going. Action despite fear, not absence of fear.

**Connection:** Builds on Monday (client acquisition fear), Tuesday (relief behaviours), Wednesday (controlled exposure). This week's thread is complete: name the fear → notice the escape patterns → find the controlled step → do the reps consistently.

---

## Wednesday 4 Feb
**Question:** What's one controlled, manageable step you could take to expose yourself to a fear you have?

**Summary:** Storytelling and social performance. Not formal public speaking (that's improving, especially since weight loss), but the ability to hold court, tell stories engagingly, and stay on track without losing the thread. In professional settings, comfort zone of knowledge and expertise makes performance manageable. The gap is social contexts and unstructured communication — fluctuates between being "part of the beating heart" and wanting to leave.

**Key themes:**
- **Physical anxiety in performance moments** — sweating, self-consciousness in high-stakes settings. Miami pitch to 40 AWMM board members is the defining example: walked in, saw the long table with a chair in the middle, had a moment of panic, composed himself in another room, then delivered brilliantly. Six years later, still the longest-serving client.
- **Weight loss has helped** — less self-conscious, better at natural communication without over-preparation. Appearance was feeding the anxiety loop.
- **Deep discussion vs storytelling** — natural mode is deep, contemplative discussion (like Sam Harris). Struggles with remembering details for stories, keeping them concise, landing them engagingly. "I'm about discussing things rather than telling stories."
- **Social battery tied to mindset** — when work feels under control, socialising lands well. When overwhelmed, avoidance kicks in. Stone Roses gig example: didn't want to go, felt like "a trip down bad memory lane," but went for Tom.
- **Alcohol as social lubricant** — recognises the pattern. Socialising without drinking feels harder, but drinking produces the next-day low. Trapped between two uncomfortable choices.
- **Writing as a potential path** — "I used to really love writing when I was younger." Cares about how he comes across in writing. Could be a route to sharpening storytelling without the live performance pressure.
- **No clear step identified yet** — ruled out TED talks (destination, not a step) and creative writing courses (wrapping fear in skill development). Knows it's in the "realm of getting better at storytelling" but hasn't landed on the specific action.

**Key insight:** The fear isn't public speaking in professional contexts — that's improving. It's *unstructured social performance* where there's no expertise to lean on. The controlled step hasn't been identified yet, but the territory is clear: storytelling, holding attention, being engaging without alcohol as a crutch and without a professional brief to anchor to.

**Connection:** Builds on Monday's OYTS (client acquisition fear) and Tuesday's (relief behaviours including alcohol). The thread this week: fear → relief behaviours → controlled exposure. Today's was supposed to produce the actionable step but instead surfaced a deeper, more personal fear than the business one. The storytelling/social performance fear connects to Bug #5 (clients buy Scott) — if the professional performance depends on expertise comfort zones, expanding the comfort zone through storytelling would serve both personal and professional growth.

---

## Tuesday 3 Feb
**Question:** What short-term 'relief behaviours' do you use to escape fear — and how are they reinforcing the fear loop?

**Summary:** Three relief behaviours identified: (1) Alcohol — wine/whiskey to "take the edge off." Burns Night hangover proved the point in stark contrast to Dry January clarity. Alcohol dulls rational thinking, makes him sound convincing even when wrong, undermines conversations with Jo. (2) Checking out / avoidance — finding strange temporary relief in not addressing the next step. (3) Preemptive resentment and catastrophising — getting agitated about rejection before it happens. Feels like "taking action" but actually avoids approaching the problem constructively.

**Key themes:**
- *"When I'm not at my best... I don't tend to rationalise, be as rational"* — alcohol removes the deliberate, contemplative thinking he needs
- *"I sound convincing even when I'm wrong"* — dangerous self-awareness about how articulate deflection masks fear-driven thinking
- Currently in a strong and serving mindset — these behaviours aren't active right now, but he knows the triggers (tiredness, unpredictable work, doubt)
- Anti-spiral skill is holding: *"I've hit the reset button... I get back on the horse"*
- Catastrophising masquerades as action but doesn't produce better thinking or solutions

**Key insight:** The three behaviours form a cascade: fear triggers either numbing (alcohol), avoidance (checking out), or false action (catastrophising). None of them address the actual fear. The daily system is the defence — when the system runs, these behaviours have less space. He knows this. The question is whether he'll recognise the early signals in real time.

**Connection:** Builds directly on Monday's OYTS (client acquisition fear). Yesterday named the fear; today names what he does to escape it. The thread is deepening — fear → relief behaviour → reinforcement loop. Tomorrow's question (controlled exposure) should produce the actionable response.

---

## Monday 2 Feb
**Question:** What specific fear is currently limiting your progress, performance, or confidence?

**Summary:** Client acquisition. Two connected fears: can't win new work, and might lose existing clients — specifically AWMM to TCS. Rational self sees the positioning is strong and behaviour is right (cooperative, enabling, enthusiastic with Danny and Dawna), but the fear has real grounding: only 3 clients, all came from warm introductions, and this outbound approach is genuinely new territory.

**Key themes:**
- *"I'm out of my comfort zone... I have not done this kind of thing before"* — honest acknowledgement, not defeatism
- TCS fear is worst-case thinking, acknowledged as such. Knows how big consultancies behave — expects them to see CS as "in the way." But comporting himself well regardless.
- The real fear is existential: not enough clients + no proven acquisition method = vulnerability
- But: *"I'll do it once and I'll do it twice and I'll do it 3 times and we will be persistent and we will evolve"*
- Self-aware about the emotional volatility: *"I'm just as likely to flip to the opposite end of the spectrum in the next 3 hours"*
- Landing statement: *"I'm not gonna let it cause me to spiral"*

**Key insight:** The fear is grounded in reality but the response is healthy. He's naming it, acting on it (LinkedIn mining with Emma today), and committing to persistence. The anti-spiral mindset from January is holding.

**Connection:** Fear theme this week was a good call. This OYTS surfaced the thing that kept him awake at 1am. Now it's named and being acted on.

---

## Sunday 1 Feb
**Question:** Which habit, if done consistently this week, would create meaningful progress?

**Summary:** Hydration, without hesitation. Foundational to physiology, likely impacting sleep. Key nuance: bulk water intake before 6pm — bingeing in the evening disrupts sleep further. Mobility considered but dismissed as this week's focus — it's new, so building the habit is enough without targeting perfection. Outdoor time also surfaced as a circadian rhythm factor affecting sleep.

**Key insight:** The brain can't cope with too many changes at once. Hydration is the fix with the most downstream impact. Mobility is about showing up, not perfection. Outdoors for vitamin D and circadian rhythms — another sleep lever.

---

## Saturday 31 Jan
**Question:** What patterns are emerging — good or bad — that you need to either double down on or course-correct?

**Summary:** Deep, honest response to the AI pattern analysis. Confirmed the assessment rather than deflecting. Owned the Dry January miss cleanly. Committed to concrete February actions: mobility back in, hydration fix, exit planning mode on client acquisition.

**Double down on:**
- Morning rituals — "a month and it's worked really well... approaching my day in a much more positive and controlled way"
- Physical health — gym, badminton, running. Although running motivation dipped when Sophie went off the boil. Acknowledged: "Am I doing it with you or am I doing it for me?"
- Recovery after bad days — "avoiding a spiral after a really difficult day is an important skill I've learned"
- OYTS journaling depth — confirmed as engine of the system

**Course correct:**
- **Hydration** — "What is fucking wrong with me?" Committed to action.
- **Mobility** — hips sore after gig, reminder that daily stretching (15-20 min) serves a real purpose. February objective.
- **Carry-forward culture** — multi-step tasks disguised as single items, not being realistic about size. Break them down.
- **Evening rituals** — "not closing down my day properly... drifting"
- **Dry January** — owned the miss: "that was an excuse." Won't schedule boozy social events during next dry month. Friday/Saturday rule holds.
- **Client acquisition** — "gotta get out of planning mode... what is the first outbound action? When's it gonna happen?"

**New thinking:**
- Manchester Marathon with Emma — emerging as a real possibility for 2027
- Christmas skiing holiday — active alternative to the sedentary, boozy British Christmas. Jo interested.
- Running needs to be for him, not dependent on Sophie's motivation
- Digital life reflections deepening — "a phone is a tool, not a companion" extended to AI: "not a substitute for a real companion"

**Key insight:** The brain can't cope with too many changes at once. January stacked a lot in. February should add mobility and hydration — targeted additions, not an overhaul. Don't overlook progress by fixating on course corrections.

---

## Friday 30 Jan
**Question:** Which of your actions this past week cast votes for the identity you're building—and which ones sabotaged it?

**Summary:** Strong identity votes this week across health, rituals, relationships, and work. The sabotaging factor is singular and specific: hydration.

**Votes cast for identity:**
- Gym 3x this week (twice so far + today — the habit is automatic)
- Running with Sophie
- Morning rituals every day — breathwork, meditation, cold water, OYTS
- Evening rituals every day
- Cold bath resilience — even on bad sleep days, getting in and doing it. "The exhilaration I feel after it makes me feel good."
- Visiting Mum and Dad on Wednesday — becoming a weekly habit
- Theatre with Eddie (Two Mayors at RSC North)
- Lake District overnight stay booked for February
- Journaling and reflection — "comes through in the day-to-day"
- Productive work week — all January tasks done except the Paul Henry email (deferred, not avoided)

**What's sabotaging:**
- **Hydration** — not drinking enough water throughout the day. Can't force it all in at the end. Poor hydration → poor sleep → challenges morning rituals. The cascade is clear.
- Self-correction in real time: "All it is is a glass of fucking water." Drink consistently through morning and afternoon. Simple fix, high impact.
- Sleep is the downstream casualty, not the root cause.

**Key insight:** The system is working. The only thing undermining it is something completely within control — drinking water. Not a mindset problem, not a discipline problem. A glass of water. The gap between where he is and where he wants to be is shrinking.

**Connection:** Links to Wednesday's OYTS (doubt as the root distraction). When the system runs well, doubt has less space. Hydration → sleep → rituals → command → doubt recedes. The chain is clear.

---

## Thursday 29 Jan
**Question:** Where are you today compared to where you said you wanted to be? What's the honest gap?

**Summary:** The honest gap is business growth. Wanted to be further along on leadership, growth focus, and being out of the numbers. But priorities were elsewhere — health and family — and both have been hugely successful.

**Key themes:**
- **70/30 split** — 70% of the gap was unavoidable (health transformation, family presence, problem projects requiring intensity). 30% is style — the old patterns of doing rather than leading. That 30% is what the daily routines are designed to fix.
- **Health as prerequisite** — wouldn't be able to do the next phase of business growth without being physically and mentally in shape first. The health work wasn't a detour — it was foundational.
- **No failure framing** — sees everything as learning and growth. "Calm seas do not a good sailor make." Growth mindset fully embedded.
- **Resource growth philosophy** — won't hire ahead of demand ("grow resource on a bet"). Prefers to double down as a team during growth, prove it, then scale. Pragmatic.
- **New resource in the team** — with additional resource (Becky), the intense periods should be avoidable unless genuinely in a growth phase.

**Key insight:** The business gap isn't a failure — it's a sequencing choice. Health first, then business growth. The foundation is now solid enough to shift focus. The 30% that's "style" is exactly what the Natural Edge system is designed to address.

**Connection:** Links directly to Monday's OYTS (equanimity, being in command) and Tuesday's (health as magnetic goal, business growth emerging as second magnetic goal). The sequence is becoming clear: health → routines → command → leadership → growth.

---

## Wednesday 28 Jan
**Question:** What distractions or temptations are most likely to knock you off course—and how will you handle them?

**Summary:** Doubt is the root distraction. Food and alcohol are the temptations that arise from it — coping mechanisms during stressful, doubt-heavy periods. Not addiction-level, but patterns that undermine performance.

**Key themes:**
- **Doubt as the root cause** — doubt about achieving targets, delivering projects, leading the team effectively. When doubt builds, food becomes reward/comfort, alcohol becomes relaxation crutch.
- **Food pattern identified** — history of disordered eating (skipping meals, late-night bingeing) driven by stress. GLP-1 helping now, but post-medication habits need to change: eat 3x/day, fuel the exercise regime.
- **Alcohol rules set** — Friday and Saturday only, post dry January. Jo didn't love it, but these are his rules. Removes midweek drinking as a stress response.
- **Daily routines as the defence** — second time doing Natural Edge rituals (first was 5 months). This time committing all year. Building a resource of journals and reflections that keep him in a strong and serving mindset.

**Key insight:** "I will tackle doubt by being in command of my life." The coping mechanisms (food, alcohol) are symptoms. The cure is the system — routines, exercise, structure, discipline. When the system is running, doubt has less space to operate.

**Connection:** Links to Monday's OYTS (equanimity, being in command) and Tuesday's (health as magnetic goal). The thread: doubt is the enemy, the daily system is the weapon.

---

## Tuesday 27 Jan
**Question:** Which Magnetic Goal is currently pulling you forward? Why does it still matter to you?

**Summary:** Health and fitness — specifically healthspan. Not just weight loss (achieved and continuing) but the way it's been done: strength training, running, badminton. Proud of the approach — getting fit and strong, not just dieting.

**Key themes:**
- **Healthspan** — wants 40+ more years in good physical and mental health. *"I want to be around for my kids as they grow older and they have kids too."*
- **Not hedonistic** — fulfilment comes from contribution to people who matter, not lifestyle excess. *"I am happy making the contribution I make to those that are in my life."*
- **Second magnetic goal emerging** — business growth through teamwork, sharing success, earning client trust. Starting to pull as strongly as health.

**Key insight:** Two magnetic goals now, not one. Health is the foundation. Business growth through team (not through Scott doing everything) is becoming the second pull.

**Connection:** Reinforces Sunday 18 Jan: *"Being fit and healthy feels like it truly belongs to me."* But now the business goal is also becoming magnetic — and framed correctly (growth through others, not through more hours).

---

## Monday 26 Jan
**Question:** What does the future version of you—the one you're becoming—look like in action this week?

**Summary:** Controlled, consistent, committed, patient. The future version shows up with equanimity in temperament and actions — daily routines done, objectives pursued, month-end close-out in sight.

**Key themes:**
- **Patience** with family and self
- **Equanimity** in demeanour — best version for decision-making and leading people
- **Outcome-focused** on the two business missions: growing client base, maximising margin from existing clients

**Key insight:** "If I'm leading myself well, then I will lead those other people well — whether it's my family or whether it's my colleagues."

**Connection:** Sets the tone for Week 4 — controlled, committed, clearing January objectives before February.

---

## Sunday 25 Jan
**Question:** What is one area where outcome visualisation and/or process visualisation could help make you stronger?

**Summary:** Business growth and eventual exit. Two-step visualisation needed:
1. **Process:** Growing to ~2.5M turnover with more professional delivery, better client acquisition, more people
2. **Outcome:** Selling the business and achieving financial independence for Scott and Jo

**Key insight:** Already has experience growing businesses/departments. The gap is regular checking against the plan, staying on top of detail and progress. Rejected the "business is in my head" framing from Eddie — hired Becky specifically to take himself out of the numbers.

**Connection:** This completes Week 3's theme on performance and preparation. The thread: visualise both process AND outcome, then work the system with discipline.

---

## Saturday 24 Jan
**Question:** What is the difference between practising a skill and priming it—and where in your life do you need more of the second?

**Summary:** Practising is physically doing the skill. Priming is creating the conditions for success — mindset, commitment structures, research, relationships.

**Successful priming example:** Gym with Lou. Paid PT (not optional), appointment in diary, good relationship, clear objective. Nearly 2 years consistent. Created conditions that made failure difficult.

**Areas needing more priming:**
- **Badminton** — enjoying it, good exercise, with friends. Only been twice, not yet a habit. Needs: research tactics/technique online, take advice from better players, commit to weekly attendance.
- **Leadership** — thinking about formalising improvement through joining a leadership group, more networking.

**Key insight:** The gym works because you primed it properly — paid commitment, scheduled time, relationship with Lou. Apply the same structure to badminton and leadership development.

---

## Friday 23 Jan
**Question:** What is a routine skill you could mentally rehearse more often to sharpen your edge (like speaking, selling, leading)?

**Summary:** Selling and leading come naturally. The skill to rehearse is mental preparation before social events and public speaking — getting into a positive, forward-looking mindset rather than defaulting to seriousness and avoidance.

**Key insight:** When overwhelmed by business responsibility, social battery drains and avoidance kicks in. But when work feels under control and there's positive anticipation (Kris Dunnico visit, Dave Jackson's 40th), the socialising lands well and feels energising.

**The shift:** Before events, mentally rehearse with a positive outlook — look forward to it, see the good in what's coming, commit to giving it best shot. This is what "sharpens the edge."

**Connection:** Links back to Monday's OYTS on public speaking. Same pattern — preparation and mindset are the enablers, not natural talent.

---

## Thursday 22 Jan
**Question:** What is a performance moment coming up soon that you can start rehearsing mentally today?

**Summary:** Tomorrow's meeting with AWMM CEO (Danny) and COO about the TCS sponsorship project. TCS is sponsoring World Marathon Majors and providing data scientists + product owner as part of the deal to build an analytics experience for the running audience.

**The opportunity:** Scott's original Data Activation Strategy (proposed 2 years ago) is now being implemented. Will be the "point man" for AWMM, running the project with TCS. Building on CS's existing data platforms gives TCS team a head start — they can focus on analytics/product rather than data integration.

**What to rehearse:**
- Understanding the landscape (already done)
- Preparation document for Danny (in progress)
- Clarity on role, value CS brings, requirements

**Key tension acknowledged:** CS could build this themselves, but can't compete with TCS on sponsorship value. Pragmatic positioning: better to be involved and shaping than marginalised.

---

## Tuesday 20 Jan
**Question:** What is a situation where you often feel nervous, scattered, or underprepared—and how would it feel to change that?

**Summary:** Client touchpoint meetings — weekly standups, project prioritisation sessions. Arrives underprepared because other work (implementation, business development) takes priority, then frantically gets up to speed an hour before.

**Root cause identified:** Absence of process, not capacity. No enforced preparation ritual for client meetings. Eddie and Emma don't have clear accountability for pre-meeting briefings.

**What needs to change:**
- Preparation done day before, not morning of
- Clear process: what's in progress, what's stuck, what's in backlog, what needs discussion
- Scott briefed properly so he's not winging it
- More formalised, professional presentation — not just Scott doing all the talking

**Key insight:** "Because I can wing it... the performance to the client is fine from my personal perspective, but I don't think it presents well with just me doing all the chat."

**Connection to bugs:** #1 (steps in), #3 (backfills expertise). The winging it pattern reinforces Scott as the safety net. Formalised prep process would force the team to own the narrative.

**Action flag:** This is a process workstream item. Add to MI → Process → Governance sequence.

---

## Monday 19 Jan
**Question:** What is one performance you want to feel automatic and instinctive—what would perfect execution look like?

**Summary:** Public speaking — both formal engagements and personal contexts (toasts, saying a few words at events). Tendency to shy away from these, influenced by how he's feeling about appearance and mental state.

**Perfect execution:**
- Visibly confident, engaging, welcoming, warm
- Grab attention of the audience, speak with confidence and authority
- Good humour where appropriate
- Land the message well with an engaged crowd

**What enables it:**
- Preparation: understanding the audience, understanding the subject, connecting the two effectively
- Rehearsal
- Practice — "the more you exercise those muscles"

**Key insight:** Public speaking avoidance is tied to self-perception in the moment. When feeling confident in own skin, it comes more naturally. The skill can be developed through deliberate practice.

---

## Sunday 18 Jan
**Question:** What is a version of success that feels truly yours—not what others expect, but what you deeply want?

**Summary:** Financial self-sufficiency + reasonably affluent, active lifestyle with wife, kids, and closest friends.

**Health as foundation:** "The health piece is a big deal" — being fit and healthy is the only way to be active and get the best from time on this earth. Doesn't feel good when under the weather, drinking too much, or not physically strong.

**Key insight:** "Being fit and healthy feels like it truly belongs to me."

**Connection to Project Eagle:** Financial security enables focus on health and relationships. Health enables everything else.

---

## Saturday 18 Jan
**Question:** What is the difference between ticking boxes and becoming someone—and how can you focus more on the second?

**Summary:** Ticking boxes is administrative — confirms action taken but doesn't convey the nature of the experience. Becoming requires internalising the experience at a deeper level.

**Meditation example:** Daily practice since Jan 1st (with 3-day break for travel). The tick box records the action, but turning up and letting practice influence attitude/behaviour/demeanour is where becoming happens.

**Key insight:** To focus on becoming over box-ticking, actions need to be automatic/natural — happening without the recording. Goals and actions must positively contribute toward "becoming" whatever is being pursued.

**Connection:** The ritual tracking is valuable for accountability, but the real work is in the practice itself and its influence on daily interactions.

---

## Friday 17 Jan
**Question:** When things get hard, what specific mental image or 'movie trailer' could you return to that would pull you forward?

**Summary:** Initial instinct was hero overcoming adversity. But nuance needed: response to adversity must remain measured — responsible to commitments, but not at all costs.

**The image:** Sat at the top of a mountain having scaled it (dealt with difficulty), surveying other peaks and inspiring landscape. The mountain = current difficulty. Other peaks = appreciation of the moment + future challenges. The view is earned through past effort.

**Key elements:**
- Remaining in self-serving state
- Delegating priorities appropriately
- Keeping equanimity
- Emerging either victorious OR stronger (avoiding weakening of resolve/health)

**Connection to Project Eagle:** Rich metaphor combining love of hiking with determination to succeed. Life = many peaks to scale, both behind and ahead.

---

## Thursday 16 Jan
**Question:** How would you show up today if you already were the kind of person who had achieved your current goals?

**Summary:** Would show up as today — just with newer goals to pursue. Same rituals, same life focused on achievement.

**Trajectory:** Suspect goals would become more personal/health-oriented as professional success leads to commercial and financial independence. But "a good few iterations/years" of pursuing professional success remain ahead.

**Key insight:** The person who's achieved current goals isn't fundamentally different. The work continues, the focus shifts.

---

## Wednesday 14 Jan
**Question:** Choose one of your goals. What would a photo of you achieving this goal look like—and what would it say about the person you've become?

**Goals reviewed:** Three from 18 months ago: (1) Never work weekends/holiday, (2) Lose 20kg, (3) Recruit 2 new clients/year.

**Status check:**
- Lose 20kg: ACHIEVED. Photos show "a bit happier, more my old self, light behind the eyes." Lighter physically and metaphorically. 6-7kg more to go.
- Never work weekends: Mostly achieved. Weekends yes, holiday still tested.
- Recruit 2 clients/year: NOT ACHIEVED. "Failing miserably" — zero new clients in 18 months. Business healthy from existing clients but not resilient.

**Photo of success (2 clients):** Team celebrating together, sharing achievement, sharing the difficulty. Not Scott alone.

**Key insight:** "There's no way we can recruit 2 more clients without me spending a lot more of my time leading, rather than doing." To lead effectively, must be physically and mentally fit. All health and personal goals feed back into being an effective leader.

**Low-level anxiety:** Sales pressure acknowledged. "Goes with the territory."

**Action flag:** Goals are drifting — need to set new ones. The client acquisition gap is the real risk.

## Tuesday 13 Jan
**Question:** What is one outcome you would love to achieve in the next 12 months that would truly change your life? What do you see, hear, feel, smell, and sense when you imagine the moment you achieve that outcome?

**Summary:** Nothing immediately "life-changing" comes to mind. Weight loss nearly complete (2-3 months to target). Real answer emerged: business able to run without me.

**12-month vision:** Reduced to 3 days/week. Help Jo launch her business. More time outdoors — hiking, hills, sweating, inspiring views. "Spending more time in nature is a big deal for me."

**Project Eagle connection:** House in countryside, surrounded by fields instead of roofs and fences. But wary of materialistic objectives.

**Key tension:** 3 days/week is NOT consistent with growing the business. Must be present, but present as leader, not doer. Will only backfill in extreme emergencies — otherwise coach and support others to do the task.

**Conclusion:** Not one life-changing thing. Several levers being pulled: health, personal life, business. The work continues.

## Monday 12 Jan
**Question:** What is a goal you have been chasing that currently feels flat or uninspiring—and why might that be?

**Summary:** Most goals are on track (weight, fitness, business starting fresh). The "flat" feeling is about business positioning.

**Core tension:** Positioned as "data analytics consultancy" but that doesn't capture what we really are — a specialist squad that gets shit done under Scott's leadership across multiple technology domains. Data is a means to an end, not the whole offering.

**WMM example:** They didn't hire us for data analytics. They wanted Scott's tech leadership and consulting capability. Data was just part of it.

**What's uninspiring:** The current messaging feels limiting. "Paying homage to one thing troubles me because we can do more than that."

**The work this year:** Learn how to frame what we are through conversations with prospects. Make sure it comes through in marketing, LinkedIn, sales meetings, and existing client relationships. Some existing clients don't understand what we could do for them.

**Connection to bugs:** #5 (clients buy Scott). The value is the leadership and ability to bridge gaps — not a narrow service definition.

## Sunday 11 Jan
**Question:** Which decisions did you make this week that technically didn't need to be yours, even if you were capable of making them?

**Summary:** Not many this week (quieter period), but one clear example.

**Eddie example:** Eddie estimated 14 days for a piece of work. On a client call, client asked for more scope and Eddie made it sound trivial. Scott stepped in on the call to flag it needed review, then gave feedback afterwards: go back with a formal quote including contingency, and in future — don't commit to additional scope on the spot. You can always say "leave it with me."

**Why it shouldn't have been Scott's decision:** Eddie knows better by now. The impulse to be "the good guy" and helpful is understandable, but "we're not doing a favour for a mate — we're a commercial entity."

**Connection to bugs:** #2 (takes on ambitious projects, absorbs margin hit). Eddie's instinct to over-promise creates exactly this pattern.

**Note:** Quieter week for examples. This question will be more revealing in full-flow work weeks.

## Saturday 10 Jan
**Question:** When you delegate, where do things most often break down, and how much of that comes from unclear mission briefs rather than poor execution?

**Summary:** People-dependent, and a mix of both — but briefing isn't the core issue.

**Innovation/uncertainty work:**
- Scott is comfortable operating in uncertainty (working with concepts, pushing strategic boundaries, bridging tech/business gap). Most staff are not.
- Phil handles freedom well once he has context, but pushing beyond boundaries isn't his default.
- Clients value Scott specifically for this capability — they've had tech opportunities slip away with IT people who couldn't bridge the gap. This is why they buy "Scott."
- When staff push boundaries without close supervision, problems occur. When they don't bring best practice to technical implementation, quality suffers.
- Commercial/time pressures compound the problem — innovation work and tight deadlines don't mix well.

**Scott's protective role:** Shield team from commercial pressure, give space to learn, don't bite off more than can chew, stay close to details on risk factors.

**Admin/operational delegation:**
- Briefing isn't the problem. Experience and expertise are.
- Junior or inexperienced staff (Leanne, Eddie specifically) can't take outcome-based briefs and deliver without leaving holes to plug.
- Creates "might as well have done it myself" sensation.

**Connection to bugs:** #1 (steps in), #3 (backfills expertise gaps), #5 (clients buy Scott). The nature of the work and the experience gap in the team reinforce why Scott stays central.

**Key tension:** The very thing clients pay for (Scott's ability to operate in uncertainty and bridge gaps) is the thing that's hardest to delegate.

## Friday 9 Jan
**Question:** What resources, authority, or support do people hesitate to use because they're unsure what's actually available to them?

**Summary:** Not a clarity problem — it's a "me" problem. The main resource people think they need is Scott, and some think he's too busy. But it's person-specific:

**By person:**
- **Emma** — Model. Knows how to use Scott, proactive, independent, loops in appropriately. No issue.
- **Dave** — Similar. Loyal, given latitude during wife's medical situation. Could be more proactive but solid.
- **Phil** — Too independent. Avoidance pattern — doesn't want help, wants his own way. Long relationship, manageable. Message landed on not over-servicing clients.
- **Anthony** — Won't use support from Scott or others, over-relies on Dave. Training resources available but struggles with tests — on pause.
- **Eddie** — Uses Scott TOO MUCH. Lacks confidence, resilience, authority skills. Likely depressed. Stuck in Scott's Northstar, not his own. Paid well so feels trapped. Scott's been harsh on his decisions before — needs to measure feedback better. Good example yesterday: measured, supportive feedback that landed well. But this won't fix the deeper issue.
- **Becky** — Excellent. Resourceful, proactive, uses everything available. Early days, not yet invested with authority.

**Key insight:** The question reframed itself. It's not "what resources are unclear" — it's "what's the relationship each person has with using me as a resource, and what does that reveal?"

**Eddie flag:** This is the clearest signal yet that Eddie's situation needs addressing. Not a performance problem — a life problem. He's stuck.

## Wednesday 7 Jan
**Question:** Which part of your identity is most tied to being "the one who knows" or "the one who fixes," and how does that shape the way you lead?

**Summary:** "The one who knows" is core to professional identity — 30 years synthesizing technology fast, pride in quick understanding, leads with opinions to shape the team.

**Tension:** Comfortable as the knowledgeable one, but gets frustrated when pulled into "the one who fixes" role. This happens when managers can't handle difficult techies — has to interpret and firefight instead of direct.

**Impact on leadership:** Fixing and interpreting drains leadership capacity. Backfilling the gap instead of developing the capability in others.

**Connection to bugs:** #1 (steps in), #3 (backfills expertise gaps). The managers who can't navigate technical people are the structural gap.

**Open question:** What would it take for those managers to handle it themselves — even badly at first?

---

## Tuesday 6 Jan
**Question:** How would your business behave tomorrow if you were unavailable for an entire week, and what does that reveal about its fragility or resilience?

**Summary:** Emma would be fine — commercially experienced, independent. Eddie raised concerns — legitimate feelings, but pattern of inverting confidence issues into other people's problems, then refusing to engage with responsibilities. Ready with objections to everything. Need to help him help himself, or at least keep him focused on key tasks.

**Rest of team:** Phil, Dave, Becky would stay busy for a week. Anthony wouldn't.

**Key insight:** What about a MONTH? Business would grind to a halt. Responsibilities, processes, policies, oversight — all concentrated in my hands and head.

**Connection:** This is exactly why the mini-retirement thinking matters. If a month breaks the business, the structure isn't right.

---

## Monday 5 Jan
**Question:** Which decisions currently run through you by default, and how does that affect your ability to think strategically?

**Summary:** Almost all decisions run through me by default. Realistic that team aren't experienced enough yet — but this means time is occupied with tactical, not strategic.

**By person:**
- **Emma** — Trusted on WMM (e-commerce, commercial, relationships). Not tech design.
- **Phil** — Trusted on existing platforms, but not bigger picture or reducing dependency on himself. Sees change as weakening his position. Needs better framing with intent and objectives.
- **Eddie/Trustmark/Impower** — Key dependencies on me that drain time.
- **Dave** — Hasn't taken on responsibility well (personal issues), but those are behind him. Can invest in delegation now.
- **Becky** — Learning. Support her to do the do, not do it for her.

**Key insight:** Christmas break gave perspective and distance. Setting up for a better outcome — but the work is framing responsibilities with intent, not just tasks.

**Connection to bugs:** #1 (steps in), #3 (backfills expertise), #5 (clients buy Scott).

## Tuesday 30 Dec
**Question:** How would your business behave tomorrow if you were unavailable for an entire week, and what does that reveal about its fragility or resilience?

**Summary:** Two-speed business. Majors side (Emma, Phil) would run fine — clear roadmap, Emma owns commercial performance, Phil takes ownership even without formal structure. Trustmark/Power side would stall — too dependent on Scott for decisions, unclear workload, team would be stuck.

**Key Insights:**
1. Partial resilience exists where responsibility is clear (Emma on WMM)
2. Phil operates well because of long working relationship, not formal structure — fragile if he left
3. Responsibility gap + expertise gap on Trustmark side = structural problem
4. Fix is clear: job descriptions, responsibility mapping, SOPs
5. Some clients don't warrant ongoing deployment — project-based model may be more honest

**Connection to bugs:** This is Bug #3 (backfills expertise gaps) and Bug #5 (clients buy Scott) in action.
