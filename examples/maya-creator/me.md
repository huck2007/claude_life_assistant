# Me

> Maya — 31, marketing manager by day, aspiring content creator.

## Life Mission

> 'I want to help people through my content and eventually make it my full-time thing.'

---

## Current Operations

### Mission 1: AUDIENCE
**Why:** Can't go full-time creator without an audience first.

| Milestone | Target Date | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| 1,000 followers | Mar 31 | In progress |
| First $100 from content | Apr 30 | Not started |

### Mission 2: DAY JOB
**Why:** Pays the bills while I build.

| Milestone | Target Date | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Stay employed | Ongoing | In progress |
| Don't burn out | Ongoing | At risk |

## What I Want

### Surface Layer
> 'Build an audience and eventually quit my job.'

### What's Underneath
> 'I want to be known for something I created, not just my job title.'

### The Core
> 'I need to know I have something valuable to say.'

## What Drives Me

- [x] Creative expression
- [x] Making an impact
- [x] Recognition
- [x] Freedom / autonomy

---

## Current State

Working 9-5, trying to create content in evenings and weekends. Exhausted but excited. Haven't shipped consistently yet. Scared of putting myself out there.

---

## Identity Snapshot

- **Age:** 31
- **Location:** Chicago (CST)
- **Personality type:** ENFP
- **Philosophy:** Help people, be authentic, keep it fun.

---

## Work Patterns

### Peak Hours
- **Best:** Early morning 5am-7am (before work)
- **Secondary:** Saturday morning
- **Avoid deep work:** Weekday evenings (too tired after work)

### What Productive Flow Looks Like
- Writing without editing
- Recording without stopping
- Losing track of time

### What Procrastination Looks Like
- Consuming content instead of creating
- "Learning" about content strategy
- Perfecting one piece instead of shipping many
- Comparing myself to big creators

---

## Recovery

### Long (2h+)
- Brunch with friends
- Netflix binge (guilt-free)

### Medium (30min-2h)
- Yoga
- Reading fiction

### Short (5-30min)
- Tea break
- Quick walk

### When Recovery is Legitimate
- After shipping content
- Sunday afternoons
- When day job was especially draining

---

## Known Bugs

1. **Perfectionism** — Won't post unless it's "good enough"
2. **Comparison trap** — Looking at big creators and feeling behind
3. **Energy management** — Day job drains creative energy
4. **Visibility fear** — Scared of being judged by people I know

---

## Core Fears

1. Being judged by coworkers/friends
2. Finding out I'm not actually interesting
3. Burning out and losing the spark

---

## How to Challenge Me

### What works
- "Did you ship this week?"
- "What's the smallest thing you could post today?"
- Reminding me that consistency > quality early on

### What doesn't work
- Comparing me to full-time creators
- Adding more to my plate
- "Just wake up earlier"

### The question that cuts through
> "Is 'not good enough' protecting you from being judged?"

---

## How I Work Best

- **Autonomy:** Medium — need some structure but not micromanagement
- **Clarity:** Helps to have a content calendar
- **Feedback:** Need encouragement early, honest feedback later
- **Communication:** Mix of text and voice notes

---

## What Works

- Writing (loses track of time)
- Helping people 1:1
- Riffing on ideas out loud

---

## What Drains Me

- Day job politics
- Analytics obsession
- Comparing follower counts

---

## Daily Non-Negotiables

- [ ] Create something (even a tweet draft)
- [ ] No social media before noon
- [ ] In bed by 10pm on weeknights

---

## Key Quotes

> 'I have so much I want to say, I just need to start saying it.'

---

## The Uncomfortable Truth

> 'I'm more afraid of succeeding and being visible than I am of failing quietly.'
