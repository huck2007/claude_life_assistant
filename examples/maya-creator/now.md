# LOG

## Memory (AI Notes)

### Week 8, Jan 4
- Consistency breaking through: 3 weeks of shipping weekly content
- Follower growth: 120 → 247 (doubled in 3 weeks)
- First reply from someone Maya respects: *"This is exactly what I needed"*
- Maya's reaction: *"Wait, people actually read this?"*
- Pattern shift: Posting "ugly" content is working better than perfect content never posted

### Week 7, Dec 28
- Two weeks in a row shipping content
- Visibility fear decreasing: Posted despite coworkers following
- Quote: *"Nobody at work said anything. I was worried for nothing."*
- Discovery: The judgment she feared? Didn't happen.

### Week 6, Dec 21
- Breakthrough: Shipped first "ugly" post
- Wrote draft, hit publish before overthinking
- Got 12 likes, 3 meaningful comments
- Quote: *"It wasn't perfect but people connected with it anyway"*

### Week 5, Dec 14
- Still stuck in LEARNER mode (4 weeks running)
- Watching content about content instead of creating
- Called out: "Are you learning or avoiding?"
- Defensive response, then: *"You're right. I'm scared to put myself out there."*

### Week 4, Dec 7
- Pattern emerging: Tutorial hell
- Enrolled in 3rd "content creation course" this month
- Zero posts published
- When asked why: *"I don't feel ready yet"*

### Week 3, Nov 30
- Day job particularly draining this week
- Planned to create in evenings, too tired
- Shifted strategy: Wake up 5am-7am before work
- Quote: *"I have energy in the morning, just have to protect it"*

### Week 2, Nov 23
- Wrote 3 drafts, published 0
- Each draft "not good enough"
- Comparison trap: Looked at creator with 50K followers, felt behind
- Underlying: *"I'm more afraid of succeeding and being visible than failing quietly"*

### Week 1, Nov 16
- Setup complete. Mission: 1K followers by Mar 31, $100 by Apr 30
- Current followers: 120 (stagnant for 6 months)
- Working 9-5, creating in margins
- Core fear: Being judged by coworkers/friends
- Known bugs: Perfectionism, comparison, energy mgmt, visibility fear
