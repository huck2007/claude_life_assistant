## Morning
**MIT:** Record and post one video

## Notes
- Woke up at 6am, made coffee, sat down to record
- Spent first 30 min "reviewing the script" (procrastinating)
- Claude asked: "What if you just hit record and talked for 5 minutes? No script."
- That felt terrifying — which meant it was probably right
- Did it. Rambled for 8 minutes. Edited to 5.

## Evening
- Posted the video at 2pm
- 50 views by end of day (personal best!)
- Got 2 nice comments from strangers
- Cried a little (good tears)

## Energy
Started nervous, ended energized

## Content shipped
- 1 YouTube video: "What I wish I knew before starting content creation"
