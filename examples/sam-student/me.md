# Me

> Sam — 24, career changer, learning to code while working part-time.

## Life Mission

> 'Break into tech and build a career where I can keep learning and growing.'

---

## Current Operations

### Mission 1: LEARN
**Why:** Need skills before I can get hired.

| Milestone | Target Date | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Complete Python course | Jan 31 | In progress |
| Build 3 projects | Mar 15 | Not started |
| Start applying to jobs | Apr 1 | Not started |

## What I Want

### Surface Layer
> 'Get a job in tech.'

### What's Underneath
> 'Prove I can reinvent myself.'

### The Core
> 'I want to feel smart and capable again.'

---

## What Drives Me

- [x] Proving myself to myself
- [x] Financial security
- [x] Fear of irrelevance
- [ ] Recognition

---

## Current State

Working retail part-time while learning to code. 2-3 hours per day available for learning. Feeling overwhelmed by how much there is to learn. Excited but scared.

---

## Identity Snapshot

- **Age:** 24
- **Location:** Portland, OR (PST)
- **Personality type:** ISFJ
- **Philosophy:** Slow and steady, but actually steady.

---

## Work Patterns

### Peak Hours
- **Best:** Morning 6am-8am (before work)
- **Secondary:** Evening 8pm-10pm (after work)
- **Avoid deep work:** After midnight (too tired, won't retain)

### What Productive Flow Looks Like
- Typing code, not watching
- Getting stuck and unstuck
- Small wins accumulating

### What Procrastination Looks Like
- Watching tutorials without coding
- Switching between courses
- "I need to learn X first before I can do Y"
- Comparing myself to CS graduates

---

## Recovery

### Long (2h+)
- Hiking
- Board games with friends

### Medium (30min-2h)
- Reading (non-tech)
- Baking

### Short (5-30min)
- Tea break
- Pet the cat

### When Recovery is Legitimate
- After coding session
- After work shift
- One full day off per week

---

## Known Bugs

1. **Tutorial hell** — Watching instead of doing
2. **Perfectionism** — Won't build projects until I "know enough"
3. **Overwhelm** — Paralyzed by how much there is to learn
4. **Comparison** — Feeling behind before I've even started

---

## Core Fears

1. Being too old/late to switch careers
2. Not being smart enough for tech
3. Wasting time on the wrong path

---

## How to Challenge Me

### What works
- "Did you write code today, or just watch videos?"
- Breaking things into tiny steps
- Reminding me that confusion is part of learning
- Celebrating small wins

### What doesn't work
- Adding more resources to learn from
- Comparing me to experienced devs
- "You should also learn..."
- Making it sound easy

### The question that cuts through
> "Are you learning, or are you preparing to learn?"

## How I Work Best

- **Autonomy:** Medium — need some structure
- **Clarity:** Clear curriculum helps
- **Feedback:** Need encouragement + honest assessment
- **Communication:** Patient, detailed explanations

---

## What Works

- Following a structured course
- Building things (even if they're bad)
- Explaining concepts out loud

---

## What Drains Me

- Information overload
- Ambiguous "figure it out" tasks
- Comparing to people who started younger

---

## Daily Non-Negotiables

- [ ] Write code (even 20 min counts)
- [ ] No tutorial without typing along
- [ ] One small win per day

---

## Key Quotes

> 'I don't need to know everything. I just need to know enough to start.'

---

## The Uncomfortable Truth

> 'Watching tutorials feels like progress but it's not. Only building is.'
