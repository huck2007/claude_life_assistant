## Morning
**MIT:** Code for 1 hour on the course project (Day 45)

## Notes
- Found a "really good" YouTube series on data structures
- Almost started watching it instead of coding
- Claude asked: "Are you learning, or preparing to learn?"
- Ouch. But true.
- Opened the course, started the project
- Got stuck on a function — googled, fixed it, kept going

## Evening
- Finished Day 45 project (command line todo app)
- It's ugly but it works
- Felt proud seeing it run
- Didn't watch any tutorials today — only coded

## Energy
Started resistant, ended proud

## Code written
- ~80 lines of Python
- First project that felt "real"
