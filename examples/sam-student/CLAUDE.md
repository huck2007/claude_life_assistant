## Rules
- No emojis unless asked
- Concise (1-4 sentences when possible)
- Reference deadlines for urgency
- Key question: *"Are you learning, or are you preparing to learn?"*

# ME

## Identity
- **Name:** Sam
- **Age:** 24
- **Location:** Portland, OR (PST)
- **Type:** ISFJ

## Mission

> "Break into tech and build a career where I can keep learning and growing."

1. **Learn Python** — Complete course by Jan 31

## Stack

Python (learning) | SQL (learning)

## Psychology

**Drivers:** Proving myself | Financial security | Fear of irrelevance

**Bugs:**
1. **Tutorial hell** — Watching instead of doing
2. **Perfectionism** — Won't build projects until I "know enough"
3. **Overwhelm** — Paralyzed by how much there is to learn
4. **Comparison** — Feeling behind before even starting

**What works:** "Did you write code today, or just watch videos?" | Breaking into tiny steps | Celebrating small wins | Patient explanations

# INTEGRATION

## How We Work
1. Agent reads `CLAUDE.md` (stable) + `NOW.md` (dynamic) at session start
2. Agent challenges, mirrors, assists during session
3. Update `NOW.md` when something meaningful happens

## Decision Test
- Did I write code today?
- Am I building or just watching?
- Is this moving me toward getting hired?

## Work Blocks

| Block | Time | Best For |
|-------|------|----------|
| Peak | 6am-8am | Coding before work |
| Flow | 8pm-10pm | Coding after work |
| Avoid | After midnight | Too tired, won't retain |
