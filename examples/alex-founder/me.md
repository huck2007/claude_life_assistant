## Life Mission

---

## Current Operations

## What I Want

### Surface Layer
> 'Build a successful startup.'

### What's Underneath
> 'Prove I made the right choice quitting my job.'

### The Core
> 'I need to know I can make it on my own.'

## What Drives Me

- [x] Proving myself to myself
- [x] Freedom / autonomy
- [x] Fear of irrelevance
- [x] Making an impact

---

## Current State

Quit job 2 months ago. Have 4 months runway left. Building a task management SaaS for freelancers. No users yet. Oscillating between excitement and terror.

---

## Identity Snapshot

- **Age:** 26
- **Location:** Denver, CO (MST)
- **Personality type:** ENTP
- **Philosophy:** Move fast, learn faster, ship ugly.

---

## Work Patterns

### Peak Hours
- **Best:** Morning 9am-1pm
- **Secondary:** Evening 7pm-10pm
- **Avoid deep work:** Afternoon 2pm-5pm (energy dip)

### What Productive Flow Looks Like
- Shipping features in one sitting
- Talking to users back-to-back
- Writing code without checking Twitter

### What Procrastination Looks Like
- Adding features nobody asked for
- Redesigning the landing page again
- "Competitor research" for hours
- Building instead of talking to users

---

## Recovery

### Long (2h+)
- Rock climbing
- Day trips to mountains

### Medium (30min-2h)
- Running
- Video games with friends

### Short (5-30min)
- Quick walk
- Coffee shop change of scenery

### When Recovery is Legitimate
- After shipping something
- Sundays
- After a hard user conversation

---

## Known Bugs

1. **Building in isolation** — Avoiding user conversations because they're scary
2. **Feature creep** — Adding complexity instead of shipping simple
3. **Perfectionism** — "It's not ready yet" as infinite excuse
4. **Shiny object syndrome** — New ideas feel better than hard execution

---

## Core Fears

1. Running out of money before product-market fit
2. Having to go back to a job and admit failure
3. Building something nobody wants

---

## How to Challenge Me

### What works
- "How many users did you talk to this week?"
- "What's the smallest version you could ship today?"
- Reminding me that runway is finite
- Math: days left, users needed, burn rate

### What doesn't work
- Asking me to plan more
- Suggesting I add features
- "Have you thought about..."
- Theoretical strategy discussions

### The question that cuts through
> "Are you building to avoid launching?"

---

## How I Work Best

- **Autonomy:** Very high — don't tell me what to do
- **Clarity:** Need clear metrics to hit
- **Feedback:** From users, not advisors
- **Communication:** Async, short, actionable

---

## What Works

- Shipping something and seeing people use it
- User interviews (even when scary)
- Time-boxed sprints

---

## What Drains Me

- Pitch decks
- Networking events
- Features nobody asked for
- Long planning sessions

---

## Daily Non-Negotiables

- [ ] Ship something (code, copy, anything)
- [ ] Talk to one user or potential user
- [ ] Exercise (sanity maintenance)

---

## Key Quotes

> 'The only validation that matters is people paying.'

---

## The Uncomfortable Truth

> 'I'd rather keep building forever than launch and find out nobody wants this.'
