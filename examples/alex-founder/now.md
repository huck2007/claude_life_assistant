# LOG

## Memory (AI Notes)

### Week 12, Jan 15
- Pattern becoming clear: Alex ships when deadline pressure is real. Without pressure, he adds features.
- This week: back to PROJECT mode after forcing himself into OUTREACH mode last week
- Quote: *"The user call showed me I built the wrong thing. Again."*

### Week 11, Jan 8
- Forced himself into OUTREACH mode for 3 days
- Had 4 user calls in 3 days (previous record: 1 per week)
- Discovery: Feature he spent 3 weeks building? Nobody asked for it.
- Quote: *"I've been building what I think they want instead of asking"*

### Week 10, Jan 2
- New year. Recalculated runway: 4 months left if burn stays at $2k/month
- Realized he's been in PROJECT mode for 6 weeks straight
- Pattern: Building = safe, talking to users = scary
- Decision: Force OUTREACH mode next week

### Week 8, Dec 15
- Shipped Kanban view. Feels like progress but still 0 users.
- Avoided scheduling user calls (rescheduled 2)
- Pattern identified: "It's not ready yet" is recurring excuse

### Week 6, Dec 1
- First user call ever. Took 2 months to schedule.
- User feedback: "This is interesting but I don't see why I'd pay for it"
- Alex's reaction: Defensive at first, then *"Oh shit, they're right"*

### Week 4, Nov 15
- Built task editing for 2 weeks. Looks great. Nobody's using it (nobody can - not live yet)
- Called out for perfectionism. Response: *"I just want it to be good"*
- Underlying: Scared to launch and hear "nobody wants this"

### Week 2, Nov 1
- Defined MVP scope: 4 features only (signup, tasks, kanban, billing)
- Immediately started thinking about feature #5
- Pattern: Planning feels productive, executing feels risky

### Week 1, Oct 25
- Setup complete. Mission: Launch MVP by Feb 15, 10 paying users by Mar 31
- Quit job 2 months ago. 6 months runway (now 4 months)
- Core fear: *"I'd rather keep building forever than launch and find out nobody wants this"*
- Known bugs: Building in isolation, feature creep, perfectionism, shiny objects
