## Morning
**MIT:** Ship the signup flow (ugly is fine)

## Notes
- Started thinking about adding an analytics dashboard
- Claude stopped me: "Is that in the original 4 features?"
- It wasn't. Refocused on signup flow.
- Had the urge to make it "really polished" — caught myself
- Shipped ugly signup by 2pm

## Evening
- Signup flow is live (basic but works)
- Scheduled 2 user calls for Thursday
- Feeling good about momentum

## Energy
High — shipping feels good

## User calls
- Scheduled: 2 for Thursday
