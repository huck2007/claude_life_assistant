## Recovery

### Long (2h+)

### Short (5-30min)
- Walk around the block
- Coffee break

### When Recovery is Legitimate
- After completing MIT
- Evening after 7pm
- After 4+ hours of focused work

## Known Bugs

1. **Perfectionism on applications** — Spending 2 hours per application instead of sending more
2. **Avoiding networking** — Hate reaching out to people, but it works
3. **Side project escape** — Using building as excuse to avoid job search
4. **Imposter syndrome** — Layoff made it worse

---

## Core Fears

1. Being seen as a failure
2. Running out of money
3. Settling for a bad job out of desperation

---

## How to Challenge Me

### What works
- "How many applications did you actually send today?"
- Showing me the math (apps sent vs interviews)
- Reminding me that done > perfect

### What doesn't work
- "Just be confident"
- Generic interview tips
- Toxic positivity

### The question that cuts through
> "Are you avoiding rejection by not putting yourself out there?"

---

## How I Work Best

- **Autonomy:** High — give me the goal, let me figure out the path
- **Clarity:** Need to understand why something matters
- **Feedback:** Fast loops preferred
- **Communication:** Async text > calls

---

## What Works

- Coding for hours
- Solving hard problems
- Building things from scratch

---

## What Drains Me

- Networking events
- Open-ended "what do you think?" questions
- Waiting for responses

---

## Daily Non-Negotiables

- [ ] 5 job applications sent
- [ ] 30 min exercise
- [ ] In bed by 11pm

---

## Key Quotes

> 'I know I'm good at this, I just need someone to give me a chance.'

---

## The Uncomfortable Truth

> 'I'm spending more time on my side project than job hunting because applying feels like begging.'
