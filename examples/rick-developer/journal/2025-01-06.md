## Morning
**MIT:** Send 5 applications to companies I actually want to work for

## Notes
- Spent first hour on portfolio site instead of applications
- Claude called it out: "That's the third time you've mentioned the portfolio"
- Realized I'm using it as avoidance
- Sent 3 applications before lunch

## Evening
- Total applications sent: 5 (hit target)
- Scheduled another interview for Thursday
- 30 min on side project as reward

## Energy
Started slow (avoidance), picked up after getting called out
